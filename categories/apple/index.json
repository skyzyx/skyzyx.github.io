Available November 1. Starting at $499. iPad 2 sticking around for $399.\n\n## iPad mini with Retina Display\n\niPad mini with a Retina Display. Starting at $399. Available in November. Last-generation iPad mini sticking around for $299.\n\n## iPad\n\nQuietly discontinued in favor of the iPad Air.\n\n## What was not announced and/or what we didn’t get\n\nFor all the rumor and speculation from analysts and pundits, here’s where we landed.\n\n* Anybody with a brain knew that there wouldn’t be an iWatch or iHDTV.\n* No “Touch ID” fingerprint sensors in the new iPads. [We’ll be unlocking our iPads like neanderthals for the foreseeable future]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/skyzyx/status/384494631204831233\" %}}).\n* No iMac or Mac mini updates.\n* No Apple TV updates.\n* No updates to the Thunderbolt display. (I was secretly wishing for a Retina-capable Thunderbolt display with 4K resolution.)\n* iPad Air gets the same larger-pixel update as the iPhone 5s got for better indoor shots, but stays at 5 MP.\n* iPad Air and iPad mini are still on 802.11n wireless networking speeds, but the iPad Air makes up for it with dual-signal [MIMO networking]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/MIMO\" %}}).\n* No Gold/Champagne-colored iPads.\n* After reading through the things that the analysts are saying about Apple, they still have absolutely no idea how Apple works — despite Apple operating like clockwork, year after year.\n"},

Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, it’s spelled \u003cem\u003elightning\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced.

With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time.

You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it.

        "plain":"A recent editorial on Business Insider layer out a number of reasons why the author, Ed Conway, was “leaving Apple”. This is my response.\nSelf-Indulgent Weiner In his editorial, Ed Conway wrote:\n Dear Tim,\nThere’s no easy way to put this so I’ll just come right out with it. I’m leaving you. It’s been great (mostly) but it’s over.\nI figured the least I could do is to explain my decision in full – I like to think it might help protect you from nasty break-ups like this in the future.\n I can’t help but think of the “self-indulgent weiner” line delivered by Nicholas Cage as Memphis Raines in the movie Gone in Sixty Seconds.\nEd, you’re going to complain in an effort to get page views. You’re trolling the Apple/anti-Apple crowds to get attention. That, sir, makes you a whore.\nLong-time Apple user  I’ve been with you, with Apple I mean, for 13 years now – ever since 1999. Perhaps you’ve forgotten: I was a spotty teenager; I bought one of your cute little translucent iBooks. Slowly but surely I painted most parts of my technological life a bright shade of Apple. Let’s see: I’ve owned two iMacs, a number of iBooks, countless Macbooks (I’ve currently got two on the go, for some unknown reason), an iPhone for almost five years, an iPad since the very beginning; iPods, iPod touches, iPod nanos – I’ve had ‘em all. I even invested in an Apple TV and, wait for it, a G4 Power Mac Cube (yes, that was me!).\n So, you’ve been an Apple user for a long time. That’s awesome. It’s made your life better, hasn’t it?\n I’ll admit I became dependent on you – clingy, even. When I went to the States a couple of years back I shelled out hundreds of dollars to ensure I wouldn’t be without an iPhone – even though I was back at college and wasn’t exactly rolling in it. And like so many of those who fall in love with you, soon enough I found myself working part-time as your best PR spokesman: I spent hours persuading all my friends to buy your stuff. I even wrote a blog about what made Apple such a dynamic, innovative and successful company.\n Blog post. You wrote a blog post, you idiot. A “blog” is a collection of posts, not a single one. You don’t “write a blog”, you \u0026ldquo;write a blog post\u0026rdquo;.\nBut that’s neither here nor there. It simply gives me a baseline of your intelligence so that I know whether I can gear my language and logic up or down. Clearly, it’s down.\nThe hype  Like millions of others, I really believed the hype.\n Yes, because Apple’s success has been built on hype, and hype alone. (If you believe this, then I have some ocean-front property in Arizona to sell you.)\nApple builds some of the fastest, thinnest and lightest computers with incredibly high build quality. The ones with some of the best displays (in terms of resolution (2880x1800), pixel density (326ppi) and color accuracy), best resale value, and have the highest consumer rating. They’re #1 in U.S. unit share for notebooks (Mac) (née laptops), and #1 in worldwide unit share for tablets (iPads).\nThe’ve created not one, but two of the most user-friendly consumer operating systems on the market. They redefined not only one, not even two, but three separate industries. And all of their devices work seamlessly together to create a really fantastic experience.\nBut no, it’s just hype.\nMore uninformed stupidity  I never thought I would utter these words, but here goes: I’m leaving you. I have already traded in my iPhone for a Samsung.\n A Samsung. One whole Samsung. *facepalm*\n Now, I know you don’t like lists (at least I presume that’s why you avoided including a task application in Mac OS and iOS for so many years) but it’s only right that I run through the issues:\n There has been a task manager in Mac OS (classic) as far back as System 1.0, AFAICT. Mac OS X has had a task manager since back in the NeXTStep days (1990’s). iOS didn’t support multitasking until iOS 4 (2010), and even then has chosen not to allow rampant or unchecked multitasking for user experience and battery life reasons. Every single detail about your last paragraph was 100% incorrect.\niOS 6  Yes, I know I’m hardly the first to mention this – but that doesn’t make it any less valid as a complaint. It is truly, truly awful. I’m usually ready to forgive one or two niggles in a new iteration of operating system. After all, they’re usually outweighed by the improvements. In this case, I honestly can’t think of a single new feature that in any way enhances the phone. Every change you’ve made is negative.\n There are zero features of iOS 6 that are positive? So then you must think that every single one of these features is a bad thing.\n  User must confirm access to Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos and Location Data when an app requests them.\n  It’s easy to keep contact information up-to-date with Facebook integration.\n  Asynchronous Game Center integration which allows for fantastic games like Letterpress to exist.\n  Built-in turn-by-turn navigation. 3D flyover views in Maps.\n  Siri has been improved, supports more types of information, and is available on more devices.\n  Facebook and Twitter notifications at the OS-level.\n  Shared photo streams (accessible to everyone, not just Facebook users).\n  The immensely-useful Passbook allows me to start keeping track of gift cards, tickets and other things without having to keep them in my wallet.\n  FaceTime conversations over cellular (3G, 4G and LTE).\n  Faster JavaScript, and improved CSS 3 and HTML 5 support in Safari.\n  The ability to decline calls (regardless of which view you’re in) then send the caller a message instead if you can’t talk right now.\n  Do Not Disturb settings for all of those overnight notifications, texts and drunken phone calls.\n  Automatic syncing of tabs between Safari on Mac/iPhone/iPad over iCloud.\n  Further-improved accessibility settings for people who need them.\n   The maps application is utterly horrendous; you must have known this is among the most commonly-used of all functional parts of a smartphone and that to change it quite so substantially would be seriously disruptive.\n The new Apple-powered (instead of Google-powered) Maps app has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Maps load faster (thanks to vector-based rendering), I get turn-by-turn directions with voiceover for free (this used to cost $50 for a third-party app), and the 3D “flyover” view has allowed me to discover a bunch of cool things in downtown Seattle that I never knew existed.\nThe only “loss” I experienced was transit maps. This forced me to discover a number of transit mapping applications that are way better than what I used to use Google Maps in iOS for. Two apps that I use frequently are OneBusAway and Lumatic City Maps. In a pinch, I can use Google Transit Maps in Safari.\n Take iTunes Match. In the previous iOS I could download any individual song in my iTunes Match library, so I could listen to it overseas without data or when in the Tube. Now your dreadful new operating system will only let me download whole albums […]\n This is partially false. I use iTunes Match all the time. Yes, they’ve removed the one-by-one icons for downloading individual songs. This is a little disappointing, but not super disappointing. I often use playlists (including Smart Playlists) in iTunes, so it’s pretty easy for me to add a song that I want to a playlist, then sync down that playlist.\n […] and then won’t let me delete them afterwards, so my iPhone gets clogged up with stuff before arbitrarily deleting precious chunks of data when it reaches capacity.\n Not true, but deleting songs is more complicated as you need to turn off iTunes Match, then manually delete individual songs one-by-one from the list view.\nThis argument is less moronic than the others… so far.\n As do I find the fact that you now seem to have decided to allow the iOS to decide unilaterally to use the telephone network rather than wifi when it so chooses.\n What? I have no idea what you’re talking about here.\n Given how badly you screwed up with the whole secret GPS-tracking of iPhone users, I’d have thought you realised we don’t like it when you behave creepily like this. It’s seriously not cool, but then more on that later.\n Oh, you mean how the complete opposite of your statement is the truth?\n All the new, exciting apps you’ve brought in are, I’m afraid to say, rubbish.\n Let’s take a look.\n Podcasts: dismal and buggy.\n Yes, Podcasts 1.0 was a terrible app. But we’re no longer talking about iOS 6.\n Facebook integration: should have been there years ago.\n Apple gave you what you wanted, and now you’re complaining.\n Passbook: erm – seriously?\n One of my favorite additions, actually. I use it frequently.\n Siri’s improvements are lost on me because, like most users, the only time I’ve engaged with Siri is to see how many swear words he/she/it understands (answer: a surprising number).\n I’ll now have to take back my not-so-moronic statement about you that I made earlier.\n Finally, for some reason iOS also seems to have broken the tilt-scrolling in Instapaper, which I resent because, well, I just use that app a lot.\n So do I. And it works. Or were you using the iOS 6 Beta which was in, you know, beta status?\nYou’ve lost it  This is going to sound awful, but I can’t think of any big product you’ve re-imagined well since the iPad, and that was almost three years ago.\n Stupidity should be painful. It seems as though Ed believes that if things don’t change radically from one iteration to the next, then they suck. Dude, take your Ritalin and calm your ADHD-ass the **** down.\n iCloud? Not as good as dropbox, and actually more confusing. FaceTime? Slick, but still pales in comparison with Skype. iMessages? Mostly annoying, particularly when it sends messages twice. Siri? See the previous point. Safari? Not as good as Chrome or Firefox. Safari’s Reader function? Not as good as Instapaper. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\n Apple has been doing this for a while, so I’m surprised that Ed — a 13-year Apple veteran — hasn’t been paying attention.\nApple does not try to replace existing apps and functionality. Rather, it seeks to chase them up the bean pole. In other words, Apple comes in to the entry level of the market (informing some people that such a market exists in the first place), and challenges the incumbents to provide mid- and advanced-level features for people who want more.\n  iCloud: Handles your fundamental syncing tasks across devices with zero effort.\n  FaceTime: Always-on. Just tap the contact info of a friend or family member with a Mac, iPhone or iPad, and the call begins. No signing up. No ads. Simple.\n  iMessages: I can send and receive messages to other Mac/iPhone/iPad users from my Mac/iPhone/iPad. Messages sync across all devices so I never have to wonder where they went.\n  Siri: Fantastic. Easy to send text messages to people via voice while I’m driving. Easy to look up turn-by-turn directions. Easy to find a list of nearby Thai restaurants, with user-submitted reviews, ratings and price information.\n  Safari: Safari is incredibly fast on Mac and iOS. It’s become my preferred browser over both Chrome and Firefox because of this.\n  Safari’s Reader function: Most people don’t realize that you can read websites with all of the ads and crap stripped out of them. Instapaper led the charge, but Pocket is also coming along. Safari Reader is an entry-level feature.\n   Plus, my Mac simply doesn’t work that well any more. The contacts on my iPhone don’t seem to sync very well with my laptop. Aperture is extraordinarily slow and buggy, Pages and Numbers are a bit of a nonsense. It just feels like you don’t make the best software anymore. And it doesn’t fit together as seamlessly as in the past.\n SOMETHING IS WRONG! FIX IT! MAKE IT WORK!\nI don’t have any of the technical problems Ed’s talking about (e.g., contact syncing). I like Pages, but I prefer to write in Markdown using iA Writer. I have no need for Numbers. Since all of Ed’s assertions are unqualified and he fails to explain anything, it’s clear that he’s just ranting about things he doesn’t (or hasn’t taken the time to) understand.\nYou’re not cool anymore  Again, this is probably a body blow, but it’s also true. It’s not merely that I now have to put up with your products being used by my mother. The fact is that Apple used to be edgy; it used to be associated with the counterculture; it used to be rebellious. I liked that. I liked the fact that you were uncompromising. […]\n Yes, and Apple also almost went bankrupt in 1996. They were rebels without a clue. Now they’re wildly successful because they chose not to follow in the footsteps of other companies… and you’re mad?\n When you introduced the iMac you ditched the serial ports and insisted everyone had to make do with USB ports, despite the fact there was approximately one printer in the world which worked with USB. You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos. There was something cool about that attitude.\n None… (reading…) yep, none of those things have changed.\n These days, you’re all too ready to compromise. Do you want to know the beginning of the end of our relationship? It was when you decided to include an SD slot in your MacBooks. Why? I can’t imagine the Apple of old ever doing this; there is no inherent reason why you need one in your laptop, save to compromise. And in compromising, you’ve become too complex.\n User research showed that lots and lots of people were using SD cards in their cameras and other devices, so Apple added an SD card reader into their laptops. Apple did what made things simpler for users.\n I remember the first iMac: it was the first computer you didn’t really need an instruction manual for. When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use. That’s the first time I’ve ever had to use an Apple instruction manual.\n You swipe. You tap. If you want to check out the settings, you tap on “Settings”. It’s really not complex. Both my son and my daughter (elementary school age) were able to pick up my iPhone (and later my iPad) and begin using them immediately with zero instruction.\nWhat does that say about you, Ed?\n Apple used to be about purity, which in turn made its products simpler and more reliable; somewhere along the way, this got lost. Or rather, Apple under Steve Jobs used to be about purity: when he wasn’t at the helm in the 90s, it also made the kind of compromises I’m talking about here.\n By “compromise”, Ed means “gave customers what they were asking for”.\nYou’re screwing us  No: the final straw was when you decided to replace the dock on the bottom of all your iPhones and iPads with the new “lightening dock”. I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\n *facepalm*\n You’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\n Firstly, it’s spelled lightning.\nSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out. But it’s also because you can spend $29 on a converter.\nMy chargers are all USB chargers, so I was able to plug the new USB-based Lightning connector in where my old USB-based 30-pin connector was. Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\nLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\n Anyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\n Again, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\nThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years. This is in stark contrast to Android-based devices which are lucky to see a single update ever.\nMacs tend to be supported with the latest updates for 5–6+ years. The latest OS X release, Mountain Lion, supports 2007-era and newer Macs. Considering that the earliest possible Macs that they could support are the first Intel-based Macs (released in 2006), this is pretty darn good.\nI don’t need you any more  I was between iPhones and I filled the lonely miserable gap with an HTC Android phone. And while I tried to ignore it at the time, the fact is, it was actually pretty good. Yes, there were niggles and a few annoyances, but we got along surprisingly well. And I’ll get on pretty well with it again, because the fact is, Tim: I’m leaving you for an Android. I can get everything I need from a phone from them as well.\n Oh, you’re only looking for a phone? Well hey, knock yourself out.\nLast year, I wrote about why Apple’s ecosystem is unmatched and how Android still has a long way to go. If you just want a phone that does some smartphone-like stuff, Android is just fine.\n My email, my messages, maps that work, my contacts (they’re stored with Google anyway and that integrates far better into an Android phone); Evernote, Instapaper, Whatsapp, my tube timetables and bus times. I’ll probably ditch iTunes Match in favour of Amazon Cloud Player or Google Drive, and, frankly, good riddance after the way you’ve treated us mobile users of the service. I’ll miss some of the apps, I’m sure – Reeder to name just one. I’ll miss the hundreds of text messages sitting on my iPhone. I’ll miss… Actually, I can’t think of anything else right now.\n If you’re invested in the Google platform for your contacts, calendars and email, then the Google mobile OS might be a good fit for you. I used Google for contacts and calendars for 4 years and have used Google for email since I got into the Gmail beta in May 2004. But I’ll tell you: Moving my contacts and calendars to iCloud has been a very positive experience. Not only does contact syncing over iCloud work better, but sharing calendars with other people allows for notifications about changes for all people involved. I couldn’t get this with Google Calendar.\nI’ve used Amazon Cloud Player on Android 4.0.4 (CyanogenMod 9) and iOS, and quite frankly, it sucks. It crashes often, it doesn’t use my album artwork, and it only supports the popular-but-inefficient MP3 audio codec. It also doesn’t integrate with iTunes on my Mac. DoubleTwist is tolerable, but the integration isn’t as good there either.\nGoogle Music still requires you to upload all of your music. I have hundreds of gigabytes, so that simply isn’t going to happen.\n I’ll hang onto my iPad for the time being. I’ll certainly keep the Macbook Air – I’m not quite ready to return to Windows yet.\n Might not buy a Mac, but not ready to go back to Windows? Where else is there to go? Desktop Linux?\n Don’t take it personally. Well, do, if it helps inspire you to make better and bolder products. This need not be forever. You can still win me back: but you’ll need to do something special again, like you did in the good old days. Reinvent the TV, like you reinvented the phone. Revolutionise finance. Overhaul the home entirely. Think Different – as your predecessor Steve Jobs used to say. Perhaps the problem is you’re not the same person any more. You’re not Steve. Perhaps.\n Reinventing TV takes time. You can’t just take an ancient, out-of-touch industry and change it overnight. Apple took 10 years to build out a successful media platform and top-notch mobile devices.\nIt’s nice that you want Apple do revolutionize everything, but understand that Apple is a business and they need to have the right motivation and opportunity before they can tackle a new market.\nAnd by mentioning Steve, your ignorance is showing. Moron.\n Either way, I’m tired of settling for mediocrity from you these days.\n Some of the best made, best selling products of all time. Blockbuster, record-breaking sales around the world. But because Apple is continuing to hone their skills and continually improve their products over time, they’ve become mediocre.\nAgain, go find your Ritalin and settle your ADHD-ass the **** down.\nConclusion So, Ed, let me get this straight.\n You like your MacBook Air and you don’t want to go back to Windows. You like your iPad (that presumably has iOS 6, and you didn’t mention how anemic the Android tablet market/experience is). You’re frustrated that the tech bloggers complained loudly about Maps and iCloud, even though both work really well. You complain about Apple not supporting their devices, then say you’re going to move to Android. You want Apple to reinvent everything, ever. But they haven’t, so they suck. You want Apple to introduce radical changes to their devices, but complain loudly when they change their mapping provider or introduce a new dock connector.  You, sir, are clearly the king of the morons. Congratulations.\n",

This is my response.\n\n## Self-Indulgent Weiner\n\nIn his editorial, [Ed Conway wrote]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessinsider.com/dear-apple-im-leaving-you-2012-11\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Dear Tim,\n\u003e\n\u003e There’s no easy way to put this so I’ll just come right out with it. I’m leaving you. It’s been great (mostly) but it’s over.\n\u003e\n\u003e I figured the least I could do is to explain my decision in full – I like to think it might help protect you from nasty break-ups like this in the future.\n\nI can’t help but think of the “self-indulgent weiner” line delivered by Nicholas Cage as *Memphis Raines* in the movie [Gone in Sixty Seconds]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187078/quotes\" %}}).\n\nEd, you’re going to complain in an effort to get page views. You’re trolling the Apple/anti-Apple crowds to get attention. That, sir, makes you a whore.\n\n## Long-time Apple user\n\n\u003e I’ve been with you, with Apple I mean, for 13 years now – ever since 1999. Perhaps you’ve forgotten: I was a spotty teenager; I bought one of your cute little translucent iBooks. Slowly but surely I painted most parts of my technological life a bright shade of Apple. Let’s see: I’ve owned two iMacs, a number of iBooks, countless Macbooks (I’ve currently got two on the go, for some unknown reason), an iPhone for almost five years, an iPad since the very beginning; iPods, iPod touches, iPod nanos – I’ve had ‘em all. I even invested in an Apple TV and, wait for it, a G4 Power Mac Cube (yes, that was me!).\n\nSo, you’ve been an Apple user for a long time. That’s awesome. It’s made your life better, hasn’t it?\n\n\u003e I’ll admit I became dependent on you – clingy, even. When I went to the States a couple of years back I shelled out hundreds of dollars to ensure I wouldn’t be without an iPhone – even though I was back at college and wasn’t exactly rolling in it. And like so many of those who fall in love with you, soon enough I found myself working part-time as your best PR spokesman: I spent hours persuading all my friends to buy your stuff. I even wrote a blog about what made Apple such a dynamic, innovative and successful company.\n\nBlog *post*. You wrote a blog *post*, you idiot. A “blog” is a *collection* of posts, not a single one. You don’t “write a blog”, you \"write a blog *post*\".\n\nBut that’s neither here nor there. It simply gives me a baseline of your intelligence so that I know whether I can gear my language and logic *up* or *down*. Clearly, it’s *down*.\n\n## The hype\n\n\u003e Like millions of others, I really believed the hype.\n\nYes, because Apple’s success has been built on hype, and hype alone. (If you believe this, then I have some ocean-front property in Arizona to sell you.)\n\nApple builds some of the fastest, [thinnest]({{% wayback \"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401538,00.asp\" %}}) and [lightest]({{% wayback \"http://computers.toptenreviews.com/laptops/apple/apple-macbook-air-review.html\" %}}) computers with incredibly high build quality. The ones with some of the [best displays]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density\" %}}) (in terms of resolution (2880x1800), pixel density (326ppi) and color accuracy), best resale value, and have the [highest consumer rating]({{% wayback \"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2504492/apple-mac/apple--head-and-shoulders--above-phone-rivals-in-satisfaction-survey.html\" %}}). They’re [\\#1 in U.S. unit share for notebooks (Mac)]({{% wayback \"http://www.asymco.com/2012/05/23/the-pc-market-overview-for-q1/\" %}}) (née *laptops*), and [\\#1 in worldwide unit share for tablets (iPads)]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-ipad-market-share-2012-9\" %}}).\n\nThe’ve created not [one]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/osx/\" %}}), but [two]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ios/\" %}}) of the most user-friendly consumer operating systems on the market. They redefined not only [one]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/mac/\" %}}), not even [two]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\" %}}), but [three separate industries]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/\" %}}). And all of their devices work seamlessly together to create a really fantastic experience.\n\nBut no, it’s just hype.\n\n## More uninformed stupidity\n\n\u003e I never thought I would utter these words, but here goes: I’m leaving you. I have already traded in my iPhone for a Samsung.\n\n*A Samsung*. One whole Samsung. \\*facepalm\\*\n\n\u003e Now, I know you don’t like lists (at least I presume that’s why you avoided including a task application in Mac OS and iOS for so many years) but it’s only right that I run through the issues:\n\nThere has been a task manager in Mac OS (classic) as far back as System 1.0, AFAICT. Mac OS X has had a task manager since back in the NeXTStep days (1990’s). iOS didn’t support multitasking until iOS 4 (2010), and even then has chosen not to allow *rampant* or *unchecked* multitasking for user experience and battery life reasons. Every single detail about your last paragraph was 100% incorrect.\n\n## iOS 6\n\n\u003e Yes, I know I’m hardly the first to mention this – but that doesn’t make it any less valid as a complaint. It is truly, truly awful. I’m usually ready to forgive one or two niggles in a new iteration of operating system. After all, they’re usually outweighed by the improvements. In this case, I honestly can’t think of a single new feature that in any way enhances the phone. Every change you’ve made is negative.\n\nThere are *zero* features of iOS 6 that are positive? So then you must think that [every]({{% wayback \"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-6_0/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012166\" %}}) [single]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/\" %}}) one of these features is a bad thing.\n\n* User must confirm access to Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos and Location Data when an app requests them.\n\n* It’s easy to keep contact information up-to-date with Facebook integration.\n\n* Asynchronous Game Center integration which allows for fantastic games like [Letterpress]({{% wayback \"http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/\" %}}) to exist.\n\n* Built-in turn-by-turn navigation. 3D flyover views in Maps.\n\n* Siri has been improved, supports more types of information, and is available on more devices.\n\n* Facebook and Twitter notifications at the OS-level.\n\n* Shared photo streams (accessible to everyone, not just Facebook users).\n\n* The immensely-useful Passbook allows me to start keeping track of gift cards, tickets and other things without having to keep them in my wallet.\n\n* FaceTime conversations over cellular (3G, 4G and LTE).\n\n* Faster JavaScript, and improved CSS 3 and HTML 5 support in Safari.\n\n* The ability to decline calls (regardless of which view you’re in) then send the caller a message instead if you can’t talk right now.\n\n* Do Not Disturb settings for all of those overnight notifications, texts and drunken phone calls.\n\n* Automatic syncing of tabs between Safari on Mac/iPhone/iPad over iCloud.\n\n* Further-improved accessibility settings for people who need them.\n\n\u003e The maps application is utterly horrendous; you must have known this is among the most commonly-used of all functional parts of a smartphone and that to change it quite so substantially would be seriously disruptive.\n\nThe new Apple-powered (instead of Google-powered) Maps app has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Maps load faster (thanks to vector-based rendering), I get turn-by-turn directions with voiceover for free (this used to cost $50 for a third-party app), and the 3D “flyover” view has allowed me to discover a bunch of cool things in downtown Seattle that I never knew existed.\n\nThe only “loss” I experienced was transit maps. This forced me to discover a number of transit mapping applications that are *way* better than what I used to use Google Maps in iOS for. Two apps that I use frequently are [OneBusAway]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onebusaway/id329380089?mt=8\" %}}) and [Lumatic City Maps]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumatic-city-maps/id501673331?mt=8\" %}}). In a pinch, I can use Google Transit Maps in Safari.\n\n\u003e Take iTunes Match. In the previous iOS I could download any individual song in my iTunes Match library, so I could listen to it overseas without data or when in the Tube. Now your dreadful new operating system will only let me download whole albums \\[…\\]\n\nThis is partially false. I use iTunes Match *all the time*. Yes, they’ve removed the one-by-one icons for downloading individual songs. This is a little disappointing, but not super disappointing. I often use playlists (including Smart Playlists) in iTunes, so it’s pretty easy for me to add a song that I want to a playlist, then sync down that playlist.\n\n\u003e \\[…\\] and then won’t let me delete them afterwards, so my iPhone gets clogged up with stuff before arbitrarily deleting precious chunks of data when it reaches capacity.\n\nNot true, but deleting songs is more complicated as you need to turn off iTunes Match, then manually delete individual songs one-by-one from the list view.\n\nThis argument is less moronic than the others… so far.\n\n\u003e As do I find the fact that you now seem to have decided to allow the iOS to decide unilaterally to use the telephone network rather than wifi when it so chooses.\n\nWhat? I have no idea what you’re talking about here.\n\n\u003e Given how badly you screwed up with the whole secret GPS-tracking of iPhone users, I’d have thought you realised we don’t like it when you behave creepily like this. It’s seriously not cool, but then more on that later.\n\nOh, you mean how the [*complete opposite* of your statement is the truth]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html\" %}})?\n\n\u003e All the new, exciting apps you’ve brought in are, I’m afraid to say, rubbish.\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\n\u003e Podcasts: dismal and buggy.\n\nYes, Podcasts 1.0 was a terrible app. But we’re no longer talking about iOS 6.\n\n\u003e Facebook integration: should have been there years ago.\n\nApple gave you what you wanted, and now you’re complaining.\n\n\u003e Passbook: erm – seriously?\n\nOne of my favorite additions, actually. I use it frequently.\n\n\u003e Siri’s improvements are lost on me because, like most users, the only time I’ve engaged with Siri is to see how many swear words he/she/it understands (answer: a surprising number).\n\nI’ll now have to take back my not-so-moronic statement about you that I made earlier.\n\n\u003e Finally, for some reason iOS also seems to have broken the tilt-scrolling in Instapaper, which I resent because, well, I just use that app a lot.\n\nSo do I. And it works. Or were you using the iOS 6 Beta which was in, you know, *beta* status?\n\n## You’ve lost it\n\n\u003e This is going to sound awful, but I can’t think of any big product you’ve re-imagined well since the iPad, and that was almost three years ago.\n\nStupidity should be painful. It seems as though Ed believes that if things don’t change radically from one iteration to the next, then they suck. Dude, take your Ritalin and calm your ADHD-ass the \\*\\*\\*\\* down.\n\n\u003e iCloud? Not as good as dropbox, and actually more confusing. FaceTime? Slick, but still pales in comparison with Skype. iMessages? Mostly annoying, particularly when it sends messages twice. Siri? See the previous point. Safari? Not as good as Chrome or Firefox. Safari’s Reader function? Not as good as Instapaper. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\n\nApple has been doing this for a while, so I’m surprised that Ed — a 13-year Apple veteran — hasn’t been paying attention.\n\nApple does not try to *replace* existing apps and functionality. Rather, it seeks to chase them up the bean pole. In other words, Apple comes in to the entry level of the market (informing some people that such a market exists in the first place), and challenges the incumbents to provide mid- and advanced-level features for people who want more.\n\n* iCloud: Handles your fundamental syncing tasks across devices with zero effort.\n\n* FaceTime: Always-on. Just tap the contact info of a friend or family member with a Mac, iPhone or iPad, and the call begins. No signing up. No ads. Simple.\n\n* iMessages: I can send and receive messages to other Mac/iPhone/iPad users from my Mac/iPhone/iPad. Messages sync across all devices so I never have to wonder where they went.\n\n* Siri: Fantastic. Easy to send text messages to people via voice while I’m driving. Easy to look up turn-by-turn directions. Easy to find a list of nearby Thai restaurants, with user-submitted reviews, ratings and price information.\n\n* Safari: Safari is incredibly fast on Mac and iOS. It’s become my preferred browser over both Chrome and Firefox because of this.\n\n* Safari’s Reader function: Most people don’t realize that you can read websites with all of the ads and crap stripped out of them. Instapaper led the charge, but Pocket is also coming along. Safari Reader is an entry-level feature.\n\n\u003e Plus, my Mac simply doesn’t work that well any more. The contacts on my iPhone don’t seem to sync very well with my laptop. Aperture is extraordinarily slow and buggy, Pages and Numbers are a bit of a nonsense. It just feels like you don’t make the best software anymore. And it doesn’t fit together as seamlessly as in the past.\n\nSOMETHING IS WRONG! FIX IT! MAKE IT WORK!\n\nI don’t have any of the technical problems Ed’s talking about (e.g., contact syncing). I like Pages, but I prefer to write in Markdown using [iA Writer]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12\" %}}). I have no need for Numbers. Since all of Ed’s assertions are unqualified and he fails to explain anything, it’s clear that he’s just ranting about things he doesn’t (or hasn’t taken the time to) understand.\n\n## You’re not cool anymore\n\n\u003e Again, this is probably a body blow, but it’s also true. It’s not merely that I now have to put up with your products being used by my mother. The fact is that Apple used to be edgy; it used to be associated with the counterculture; it used to be rebellious. I liked that. I liked the fact that you were uncompromising. \\[…\\]\n\nYes, and Apple also almost went bankrupt in 1996. They were rebels without a clue. Now they’re wildly successful because they chose *not* to follow in the footsteps of other companies… and you’re *mad?*\n\n\u003e When you introduced the iMac you ditched the serial ports and insisted everyone had to make do with USB ports, despite the fact there was approximately one printer in the world which worked with USB. You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos. There was something cool about that attitude.\n\nNone… (reading…) yep, none of those things have changed.\n\n\u003e These days, you’re all too ready to compromise. Do you want to know the beginning of the end of our relationship? It was when you decided to include an SD slot in your MacBooks. Why? I can’t imagine the Apple of old ever doing this; there is no inherent reason why you need one in your laptop, save to compromise. And in compromising, you’ve become too complex.\n\nUser research showed that lots and lots of people were using SD cards in their cameras and other devices, so Apple added an SD card reader into their laptops. Apple did what made things *simpler* for users.\n\n\u003e I remember the first iMac: it was the first computer you didn’t really need an instruction manual for. When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use. That’s the first time I’ve ever had to use an Apple instruction manual.\n\nYou swipe. You tap. If you want to check out the settings, you tap on “Settings”. It’s really not complex. Both my son and my daughter (elementary school age) were able to pick up my iPhone (and later my iPad) and begin using them *immediately* with zero instruction.\n\nWhat does that say about you, Ed?\n\n\u003e Apple used to be about purity, which in turn made its products simpler and more reliable; somewhere along the way, this got lost. Or rather, Apple under Steve Jobs used to be about purity: when he wasn’t at the helm in the 90s, it also made the kind of compromises I’m talking about here.\n\nBy “compromise”, Ed means “gave customers what they were asking for”.\n\n## You’re screwing us\n\n\u003e No: the final straw was when you decided to replace the dock on the bottom of all your iPhones and iPads with the new “lightening dock”. I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\n\n\\*facepalm\\*\n\n\u003e You’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\n\nFirstly, it’s spelled *lightning*.\n\nSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out. But it’s also because you can spend [$29 on a converter]({{% wayback \"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD823/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter\" %}}).\n\nMy chargers are all USB chargers, so I was able to plug the new USB-based Lightning connector in where my old USB-based 30-pin connector was. Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\n\nLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\n\n\u003e Anyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\n\nAgain, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\n\nThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years. This is in stark contrast to Android-based devices which are lucky to see a single update *ever*.\n\nMacs tend to be supported with the latest updates for 5–6+ years. The latest OS X release, Mountain Lion, supports 2007-era and newer Macs. Considering that the earliest possible Macs that they could support are the first Intel-based Macs (released in 2006), this is pretty darn good.\n\n## I don’t need you any more\n\n\u003e I was between iPhones and I filled the lonely miserable gap with an HTC Android phone. And while I tried to ignore it at the time, the fact is, it was actually pretty good. Yes, there were niggles and a few annoyances, but we got along surprisingly well. And I’ll get on pretty well with it again, because the fact is, Tim: I’m leaving you for an Android. I can get everything I need from a phone from them as well.\n\nOh, you’re *only* looking for a phone? Well hey, knock yourself out.\n\nLast year, [I wrote about why Apple’s ecosystem is unmatched](/2011/09/05/skating-to-where-the-puck-will-be/) and how Android still has a long way to go. If you just want a phone that does some smartphone-like stuff, Android is just fine.\n\n\u003e My email, my messages, maps that work, my contacts (they’re stored with Google anyway and that integrates far better into an Android phone); Evernote, Instapaper, Whatsapp, my tube timetables and bus times. I’ll probably ditch iTunes Match in favour of Amazon Cloud Player or Google Drive, and, frankly, good riddance after the way you’ve treated us mobile users of the service. I’ll miss some of the apps, I’m sure – Reeder to name just one. I’ll miss the hundreds of text messages sitting on my iPhone. I’ll miss… Actually, I can’t think of anything else right now.\n\nIf you’re invested in the Google platform for your contacts, calendars and email, then the Google mobile OS might be a good fit for you. I used Google for contacts and calendars for 4 years and have used Google for email since I got into the Gmail beta in May 2004. But I’ll tell you: Moving my contacts and calendars to iCloud has been a very positive experience. Not only does contact syncing over iCloud work better, but sharing calendars with other people allows for notifications about changes for all people involved. I couldn’t get this with Google Calendar.\n\nI’ve used Amazon Cloud Player on Android 4.0.4 (CyanogenMod 9) and iOS, and quite frankly, it sucks. It crashes often, it doesn’t use *my* album artwork, and it only supports the popular-but-inefficient MP3 audio codec. It also doesn’t integrate with iTunes on my Mac. [DoubleTwist]({{% wayback \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer\" %}}) is tolerable, but the integration isn’t as good there either.\n\nGoogle Music still requires you to upload all of your music. I have hundreds of gigabytes, so that simply isn’t going to happen.\n\n\u003e I’ll hang onto my iPad for the time being. I’ll certainly keep the Macbook Air – I’m not quite ready to return to Windows yet.\n\nMight not buy a Mac, but not ready to go back to Windows? Where else is there to go? Desktop Linux?\n\n\u003e Don’t take it personally. Well, do, if it helps inspire you to make better and bolder products. This need not be forever. You can still win me back: but you’ll need to do something special again, like you did in the good old days. Reinvent the TV, like you reinvented the phone. Revolutionise finance. Overhaul the home entirely. Think Different – as your predecessor Steve Jobs used to say. Perhaps the problem is you’re not the same person any more. You’re not Steve. Perhaps.\n\nReinventing TV takes time. You can’t just take an ancient, out-of-touch industry and change it overnight. Apple took 10 years to build out a successful media platform and top-notch mobile devices.\n\nIt’s nice that you want Apple do revolutionize *everything*, but understand that Apple is a business and they need to have the right motivation and opportunity before they can tackle a new market.\n\nAnd by mentioning Steve, your ignorance is showing. Moron.\n\n\u003e Either way, I’m tired of settling for mediocrity from you these days.\n\nSome of the best made, best selling products of all time. Blockbuster, record-breaking sales around the world. But because Apple is continuing to hone their skills and continually improve their products over time, they’ve become mediocre.\n\nAgain, go find your Ritalin and settle your ADHD-ass the \\*\\*\\*\\* down.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, Ed, let me get this straight.\n\n* You like your MacBook Air and you don’t want to go back to Windows.\n* You like your iPad (that presumably has iOS 6, and you didn’t mention how anemic the Android tablet market/experience is).\n* You’re frustrated that the tech bloggers complained loudly about Maps and iCloud, even though both work really well.\n* You complain about Apple not supporting their devices, then say you’re going to move to *Android*.\n* You want Apple to reinvent *everything, ever*. But they haven’t, so they suck.\n* You want Apple to introduce radical changes to their devices, but complain loudly when they change their mapping provider or introduce a new dock connector.\n\nYou, sir, are clearly the king of the morons. Congratulations.\n"},

The model year only matters when you need to be more specific than that.\n\nOf course, if I wanted to be even more specific, I would say that I wanted to get a “white iPhone (2012; 128 GB; Verizon LTE)”.\n\nIf I were a betting man, this is where I would put my money.\n\n## Whither the next iPhone?\n\nThe next iPhone is expected to be announced in less than a month. The most recent rumors I’ve read suggest that the next iPhone will be [announced on September 12, and begin shipping on September 21]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/ipad_mini_even_througher\" %}}).\n\n*The Infamous They* also suggest that it will have a [redesigned body with a larger screen]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/12/new-2012-iphone-body-reportedly-leaks-shows-the-glass-front/\" %}}) (if this is true, I’d bet on 1024x640 or 1536x960 (`16:10`) instead of the more awkward `16:9`), a [new 8/9-pin connector]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3261613/new-iphone-usb-cable-mini-dock-connector-leak\" %}}), [fast LTE networking]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2012/03/14/verizon-exec-slips-suggests-4g-lte-equipped-iphone-to-launch-this-year/\" %}}), a [near-field communication (NFC) sensor]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57459639-37/iphone-5-prototypes-reportedly-reveal-nfc-support/\" %}}), [larger storage options]({{% wayback \"https://www.gottabemobile.com/will-the-iphone-5-be-the-first-128gb-iphone/\" %}}), a faster [quad-core Apple A6 CPU]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57467136-233/rumor-apple-to-include-quad-core-a6-in-next-iphone/\" %}}), and more memory (*duh*).\n\nIn a few weeks, we’ll find out what I’m going to be shelling-out $399 for. :)\n"},

        "plain":"Wayne Gretzky is often credited as being the single greatest hockey player of all time. It is said that his father, Walter Gretzky, taught him the most important thing to learn in hockey:\n “Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”\n This quote in particular is one that Steve Jobs has brought up on numerous occasions, and is far more revealing about Apple’s internal culture than I think most of us realize. It is certainly the most salient explanation for Apple’s intense focus at the intersection of technology and liberal arts.\n  Mobile Over the past couple of years, I’ve started paying an increasing amount of attention to Apple and it’s competition — mostly in the mobile space. Before 2008 when I bought my first iPhone, I really couldn’t have cared less about mobile. I’d had a couple of feature phones, then moved up to a BlackBerry Pearl in 2006. When Steve Jobs got up on stage at the Moscone Center in January 2007 and introduced “[…] an iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… these are NOT three separate devices!” I was stunned. I’d heard the rumors about an alleged phone from Apple, but this thing was simply astounding! Over the next 6 months, the blogosphere worked itself into an absolute frenzy over the iPhone. Ultimately, the iPhone has gone on to be a raging success — raking in two-thirds of all of the profits in the entire mobile industry.\nHardware and software Since Apple makes both the hardware and the software for all of their products, when you buy an iPhone (or iPod, or iPad, or Mac) you know that the hardware and software work together seamlessly. With the exception of HP/Palm ([up until recently](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=touchpad discontinued) and RIM, Apple is the only company that does this. Even Google’s Nexus line of phones is actually made by third-party handset makers (HTC for the Nexus One and Samsung for the Nexus S). In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\nHardware Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  BlackBerry 8800 Research In Motion     Q Motorola     E70 Nokia     Excalibur HTC     Touch HTC     Treo 755p Palm     Treo 700wx Palm    Software Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  Palm OS 5 PalmSoft     Windows Mobile 6 Microsoft     Symbian OS Nokia     Android Google    Queue the industry scramble People in the mobile industry knew this was going to be big, huge, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next iPhone-killer. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first touchphones started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had all of the same features, so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\nThere is no tablet market — only an iPad market Verne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of The New York Times note:\n “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n Here’s what John Gruber from Daring Fireball had to say:\n “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n And Marco Arment:\n \u0026ldquo;There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t nothing, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\u0026rdquo;\n Others are saying the same thing. But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\nIt’s the ecosystem, stupid! The fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n  Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n  Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n  The iTunes Store has over 18 million songs; thousands of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 virus-free apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n  iTunes Home Sharing allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n  AirPlay (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an AirPort Express or support the AirPlay protocol.\n  You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an Apple TV also using AirPlay.\n  You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n  Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n  Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n  Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n  Compare all of this to, say, Android.\n  First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n  Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n  There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has Google Music, but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n  Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe”, “Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says”, “Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them”, and “Warning: Fake games in the Market today”.\n  There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n  There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n  There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n  What Android cottage industry?\n  Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n  Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a small subset of devices based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n  Apple’s Strategy Apple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about the digital hub dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their Rip, Mix, Burn campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n iTunes (2001) Mac OS X (2001) Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001) iPod (2001) Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002) iTunes Music Store (2003) AirPort Express (2004) iLife (2004) Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005) Apple TV (2007) iPhone (2007) iPhone Music Store (2007) iPhone App Store (2008) iPad (2010) iCloud (2011)  All of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\nSkating to where the puck has been Right now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. Everyone.\n  Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n  Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n  Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n  Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n  As technophiliacs, it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. For example, Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices. Really Samsung? In \u0026ldquo;Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong\u0026rdquo;, Zach Epstein writes:\n \u0026ldquo;Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy. The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\u0026rdquo;\n These products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\nSkating to where the puck is going to be Robert S. Andersen recently tweeted:\nEvery product is an opportunity to create joy in someone\u0026#39;s life. If you\u0026#39;re not doing that then you\u0026#39;re in it for the wrong reasons.\n\u0026mdash; rsa (@rsa) August 26, 2011 Apple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is delightful. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip:\n Harriet: I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\nMatt: That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\nHarriet: What did I do wrong?\nMatt: You asked for the laugh.\nHarriet: What did I do at the table read?\nMatt: You asked for the butter.\n If you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\nUpdate: HP Envy (2011–11–16 ) If I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new HP Envy.\n  I feel like I’ve seen this somewhere before…\nUpdate: Fun with numbers! (2011–11–24 ) In his piece entitled “Fun With Numbers”, John Gruber from Daring Fireball analyzes an NPD Group report about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., real sales numbers to consumers, not the fake we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them numbers).\n That’s one way to put it. Another way is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely considered an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, none of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011. […] PC manufacturers are not dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem — hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals — are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n He finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n ",

Before 2008 when I bought my first iPhone, I really couldn’t have cared less about mobile. I’d had a couple of [feature phones]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Feature_phone\" %}}), then moved up to a [BlackBerry Pearl]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Blackberry_Pearl\" %}}) in 2006. When [Steve Jobs got up on stage at the Moscone Center in January 2007]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/\" %}}) and introduced “\\[…\\] an iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… these are NOT three separate devices!” I was stunned. I’d heard the rumors about an alleged phone from Apple, but this thing was simply astounding! Over the next 6 months, the blogosphere [worked]({{% wayback \"http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1575743,00.html\" %}}) [itself]({{% wayback \"http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/all-things-iphone-interface-and-the-16-applications/\" %}}) [into]({{% wayback \"http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/is-apples-iphone-still-exciting-our-views-and-yours/\" %}}) [an]({{% wayback \"http://kottke.org/07/01/the-apple-iphone\" %}}) [absolute]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2007/01/09/apple-announces-iphone-stock-soars/\" %}}) [frenzy]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2007/06/07/the-futurist-we-predict-the-iphone-will-bomb/\" %}}) [over]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2007/06/14/the-futurist-why-the-iphone-reeks-of-planned-obsolescence/\" %}}) [the]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/18/steve-ballmer-laughs-off-the-iphone-deems-it-most-expensive-i/\" %}}) [iPhone]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2007/02/more_crap_from_enderle\" %}}). Ultimately, the iPhone has gone on to be a raging success — raking in [two-thirds of all of the profits in the entire mobile industry]({{% wayback \"http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/29/apple-captured-two-thirds-of-available-mobile-phone-profits-in-q2/\" %}}).\n\n## Hardware and software\n\nSince Apple makes both the hardware and the software for all of their products, when you buy an iPhone (or iPod, or iPad, or Mac) you know that the hardware and software work together seamlessly. With the exception of [HP/Palm]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/hp-touchpad-16gb/4505-3126_7-34499289.html\" %}}) ([up until recently]({{% search \"touchpad discontinued\" %}}) and [RIM]({{% wayback \"http://rim.com\" %}}), Apple is the only company that does this. Even Google’s [Nexus line of phones]({{% wayback \"http://www.google.com/nexus/\" %}}) is actually made by third-party handset makers ([HTC for the Nexus One]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/htc-nexus-one-by/4505-6452_7-33906802.html\" %}}) and [Samsung for the Nexus S]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/samsung-nexus-s-at/4505-6452_7-34431171.html\" %}})). In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\n\n## Hardware\n\nHere’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n\n{{\u003cimage-grid\u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/blackberry-8800.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/RIM_BlackBerry_8800/4505-6452_7-32329098.html\"\n        title=\"BlackBerry 8800\"\n        subtitle=\"Research In Motion\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/moto-q.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Motorola_Q_Sprint/4505-6452_7-32327377.html\"\n        title=\"Q\"\n        subtitle=\"Motorola\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nokia-e70.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Nokia_E70/4505-6452_7-32381755.html\"\n        title=\"E70\"\n        subtitle=\"Nokia\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/htc-excalibur.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/t-mobile-dash-aka/4505-6452_7-32088045.html\"\n        title=\"Excalibur\"\n        subtitle=\"HTC\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/htc-touch.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/htc-touch-unlocked/4505-6452_7-32465595.html\"\n        title=\"Touch\"\n        subtitle=\"HTC\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-treo-755p.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smart-phones/palm-treo-755p-sprint/4505-6452_7-32434432.html\"\n        title=\"Treo 755p\"\n        subtitle=\"Palm\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-treo-700wx.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/palm-treo-700wx-black/4505-6452_7-32058773.html\"\n        title=\"Treo 700wx\"\n        subtitle=\"Palm\"\n    \u003e}}\n{{\u003c/image-grid\u003e}}\n\n## Software\n\nHere’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n\n{{\u003cimage-grid\u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-os.jpg\"\n        title=\"Palm OS 5\"\n        subtitle=\"PalmSoft\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-mobile.jpg\"\n        title=\"Windows Mobile 6\"\n        subtitle=\"Microsoft\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/symbian.jpg\"\n        title=\"Symbian OS\"\n        subtitle=\"Nokia\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/android2.jpg\"\n        title=\"Android\"\n        subtitle=\"Google\"\n    \u003e}}\n{{\u003c/image-grid\u003e}}\n\n\n## Queue the industry scramble\n\nPeople in the mobile industry knew this was going to be ~~big~~, ~~huge~~, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next *iPhone-killer*. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first *touchphones* started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had [all of the same features]({{% wayback \"http://www.marco.org/2010/02/09/feature-checklist-dysfunction\" %}}), so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\n\n## There is no tablet market — only an iPad market\n\nVerne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of [The New York Times note]({{% wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/as-pcs-wane-companies-look-to-tablets.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n\nHere’s what John Gruber from [Daring Fireball had to say]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/ipad_dominance\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n\nAnd [Marco Arment]({{% wayback \"http://www.marco.org/2010/12/31/there-really-isnt-much-of-a-tablet-market\" %}}):\n\n\u003e \"There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t *nothing*, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market.

But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\n\n## It’s the ecosystem, stupid!\n\nThe fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I [wrote a couple of weeks ago](/2011/08/21/comparing-the-hp-touchpad-to-the-ipad-2/), I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\n\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n\n* Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n\n* Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n\n* The iTunes Store has [over 18 million songs]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/\" %}}); [thousands]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/itunes.html\" %}}) of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 *virus-free* apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps.

Yes, Google has [Google Music]({{% wayback \"http://music.google.com\" %}}), but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n\n* Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “[Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe]({{% wayback \"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/08/android-malware-explodes-ios-remains-safe/all/1\" %}})”, “[Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/24/android-targeted-malware-jumps-76-in-q2-mcafee-says/\" %}})”, “[Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them]({{% wayback \"http://www.technobuffalo.com/companies/google/android/why-android-viruses-are-growing-and-how-to-stop-them/\" %}})”, and “[Warning: Fake games in the Market today]({{% wayback \"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kjywq/warning_fake_games_in_the_market_today/\" %}})”.\n\n* There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n\n* There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n\n* There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n\n* What Android cottage industry?\n\n* Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n\n* Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a [small subset of devices]({{% wayback \"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient\" %}}) based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n\n## Apple’s Strategy\n\nApple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about *the digital hub* dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their [Rip, Mix, Burn]({{% wayback \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECN4ZE9-Mo\" %}}) campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n\n1. iTunes (2001)\n2. Mac OS X (2001)\n3. Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001)\n4. iPod (2001)\n5. Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002)\n6. iTunes Music Store (2003)\n7. AirPort Express (2004)\n8. iLife (2004)\n9. Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005)\n10. Apple TV (2007)\n11. iPhone (2007)\n12. iPhone Music Store (2007)\n13. iPhone App Store (2008)\n14. iPad (2010)\n15. iCloud (2011)\n\nAll of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\n\n## Skating to where the puck has been\n\nRight now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. *Everyone.*\n\n* Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n\n* Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n\n* Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n\n* Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n\nAs [technophiliacs]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Technophilia\" %}}), it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to *throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.* For example, [Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/109241074429603840\" %}}). Really Samsung? In \"[Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}})\", Zach Epstein writes:\n\n\u003e \"Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: *slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy.* The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\"\n\nThese products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\n\n## Skating to where the puck is going to be\n\nRobert S. Andersen recently [tweeted]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/rsa/status/106977599183527936\" %}}):\n\n{{\u003c tweet 106977599183527936 \u003e}}\n\nApple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is *delightful*. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\n\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, [Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip\" %}}):\n\n\u003e **Harriet:** I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\n\u003e\n\u003e **Matt:** That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do wrong?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the laugh.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do at the table read?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the butter.\n\nIf you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\n\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\n\n## Update: HP Envy ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–16\"\u003e}})\n\nIf I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new [HP Envy]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/16/2564285/hp-envy-15-and-17-press-photos\" %}}).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hp-envy.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nI feel like I’ve [seen this somewhere before]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/\" %}})…\n\n## Update: Fun with numbers! ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–24\"\u003e}})\n\nIn his piece entitled “[Fun With Numbers]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers\" %}})”, John Gruber from *Daring Fireball* analyzes an [NPD Group report]({{% wayback \"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b\" %}}) about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., *real* sales numbers to consumers, not the fake *we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them* numbers).\n\n\u003e That’s one way to put it. [Another way]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/139517109439959040\" %}}) is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely *considered* an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, *none* of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011. \\[…\\] PC manufacturers are *not* dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem — hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals — are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n\nHe finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n\n\u003e The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n"},

I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides.

        "plain":"I currently own and love my iPad 2, but with HP slashing the prices on the new TouchPads this weekend, I decided to pick one up after calling around and finding some at my local Best Buy.   Preface I feel that I should start by saying that I’m an Apple guy; or more specifically that I’ve always been an Apple guy. I was converted to the Mac platform back in the early 90’s when my Junior High school’s library got a new shipment of Apple Macintosh LC IIs. I’ve never really looked back.\nThat said, this certainly isn’t a blind love for Apple. Over the years, Apple has earned my trust by providing high-quality products, software and support that puts the consumer first. That doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ve liked every single decicion they’ve made, but all-in-all I have Apple’s back because I believe that Apple has mine.\nLet’s look at the competition:\n  RIM: RIM is dead. Sell your stock.\n  Microsoft: Irrelevant in this day and age.\n  Google:\n  They’d screw me in a second if they could sell more data about me to advertisers.\n  Google values engineering above all else. Unfortunately for Google, Design is more important than Engineering.\n  Andy Rubin has as much dumb stuff come out of his mouth as Steve Ballmer.\n  Google recently kicked off a whine-fest because they lost a patent auction.\n    Palm: CEO was a high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod. Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n  Piqued Interest I have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s Windows CE, palm-sized PC, PocketPC, Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition, Windows Mobile, Windows Embedded Handheld, Windows Phone 7 Series, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called The Paradox of Choice (TED video) (Wikipedia summary). The short version is that while people like Steve Ballmer and Andy Rubin are all touting how wonderful it is to have a plethora of devices available, it’s actually harmful to the customer experience.\nSo when Palm/HP announced the TouchPad, I was intrigued. I’d always thought that Palm’s webOS was a clear stand-out among mobile OSs, but the faulty Pre hardware and a poor at-launch partner (Sprint), and terrible marketing all worked in concert to kill Palm’s chances of making a dent in the marketplace. Palm also was in the poor position of needing a serious influx of cash if they were to continue operating. That kind of split focus is never good for a company.\nSeeing some gorgeous screenshots of the OS and devices on Sebastiaan de With’s blog pretty much sealed the deal for me: I was a webOS fan. Unfortunately for Palm/HP, there was no way I was going to spend money on a TouchPad when I could get an iPad.\n  Comparing the TouchPad and the iPad 2 I ordered my iPad 2 at the end of July, so I’ve only had my iPad 2 for about 3 weeks. I also have an iPhone 4, so picking up and using an iPad was effortless. Because of this, the iPad has set an awfully high bar in my mind.\nAfter spending a little less than 24 hours with my new 32GB HP TouchPad, here are my thoughts:\nPros   Palm/HP definitely got the packaging right. It’s the most Apple-like experience for any non-Apple product I’ve ever seen.\n  webOS is gorgeous, with an emphasis on black/charcoal colors, the Prelude system font, and high-quality iconography derived from the circle shape (Palm owns the circle). If you believe (as I do) that a software environment should look as good as it works, webOS is fantastic.\n  The TouchPad hardware is nice to the eyes and the touch. It has a sturdy (although somewhat plastic-y) feel to it.\n  Neither Netflix nor Hulu are filtering the TouchPad’s user-agent string. Hulu seems to maintain a black list for devices (Hulu has to pro-actively block devices), while Netflix seems to maintain a white list for devices (Netflix has to pro-actively allow devices). While I can watch Hulu content on my TouchPad (which comes with Flash), I can’t watch Netflix content (which requires Silverlight).\n  The bezel/cards UI is awesome.\n  Built-in support for several third-party accounts, including Skype and Dropbox. While iOS (and Mac OS X Lion) also has this, webOS’s integration seems to go a lot deeper — specifically in being able to do a decent job of merging contacts together across the various services.\n  The Facebook app (developed by Palm) beats the pants off of the phone-only iOS Facebook app. The closest competitor available for the iPad is an app called MyPad+.\n  The Last.fm app is also designed for the TouchPad, easily beating the phone-only iOS Last.fm app.\n  The photo app has built-in support for Facebook photos and videos built right in.\n  The on-screen keyboard has digits as part of its first screen. You don’t need to tap shift to get to them.\n  Cons   It’s a lot heavier than my iPad 2.\n  The screen and iPhone 3G-ish style back attract fingerprints like its their job.\n  The UI doesn’t track finger movements as quickly as iOS, so the touch/scroll responsiveness feels laggy compared to the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.\n  Actually, the whole OS is a bit laggy. It’s as if it takes a moment to “spin-up” after I launch an application or switch from one screen to another.\n  The TouchPad uses a non-standard Mini-USB cable, so my cache of leftover cables from my BlackBerry Pearl days are still as useless to me as they’ve been since I upgraded to the iPhone.\n  It doesn’t seem to charge when connected to my computer, so I need to disconnect it, climb down underneath my desk, and plug it in to get it to charge.\n  Ever heard of BeatsAudio? It’s the technology that powers the Beats by Dre headphone that are so freaking awesome. Yeah, not feeling it here. The iPad 2 speakers are better.\n  The app selection is downright awful. All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Twitter, Instapaper, Flipboard are nowhere to be found on the HP App Catalog.\n  While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n  Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is much slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the Browserscope test suite for the past couple of hours and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n  The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see Mail). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n  Syncing sucks. Even with the HP Play software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n  Conclusion All-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n  I think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer (early 2011 MacBook Pro), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire store catalog.\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s Nintendo DSs when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of New Super Mario Bros. and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\nEpilogue: Side-by-side Photos In this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n  Here they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n  Here is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n  (Photo credits: First photo by HP/Palm. Second and third photos by Sebastiaan de With. Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\nUpdate: Micro-USB (2011–08–25 ) Thanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size du jour called Micro USB. The TouchPad uses the Micro-B flavor, which is why my Mini USB cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\nUpdate: Hulu (2011–08–25 ) Over the past couple of days, Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist. Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n  Update: Preware (2011–08–25 ) Last night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered Preware. Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like Cydia and Rock Your Phone for jailbroken iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually quite OK with this community).\n  As part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \u0026ldquo;Got a slow HP TouchPad? Here are 3 easy ways to speed it up.\u0026rdquo; The first thing you learn is that webOS does a ton of logging in the background.

Google recently kicked off a [whine-fest]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20110803/microsoft-pr-ninja-strikes-back-at-google-patent-whine-with-email-jujitsu/\" %}}) because they lost a patent auction.\n\n* **Palm:** CEO was a [high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jon_Rubinstein\" %}}). Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n\n## Piqued Interest\n\nI have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s ~~Windows CE~~, ~~palm-sized PC~~, ~~PocketPC~~, ~~Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition~~, ~~Windows Mobile~~, ~~Windows Embedded Handheld~~, ~~Windows Phone 7 Series~~, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called [The Paradox of Choice (TED video)]({{% wayback \"http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html\" %}}) ([Wikipedia summary]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less\" %}})). The short version is that while people like Steve Ballmer and Andy Rubin are all touting how wonderful it is to have a plethora of devices available, it’s actually harmful to the customer experience.\n\nSo when Palm/HP announced the TouchPad, I was intrigued. I’d always thought that Palm’s webOS was a clear stand-out among mobile OSs, but the [faulty Pre hardware]({{% wayback \"http://www.precentral.net/do-you-have-palm-pre-hardware-issues\" %}}) and a poor at-launch partner (Sprint), and [terrible marketing]({{% wayback \"http://youtu.be/iIknaMyJhvw\" %}}) all worked in concert to kill Palm’s chances of making a dent in the marketplace. Palm also was in the poor position of needing a serious influx of cash if they were to continue operating. That kind of split focus is never good for a company.\n\nSeeing some gorgeous screenshots of the OS and devices on [Sebastiaan de With’s blog]({{% wayback \"http://blog.cocoia.com/2011/hp-webos-event-roundup/\" %}}) pretty much sealed the deal for me: I was a webOS fan. Unfortunately for Palm/HP, there was no way I was going to spend money on a TouchPad when I could get an iPad.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grabber.png\"\u003e}}\n\n## Comparing the TouchPad and the iPad 2\n\nI ordered my iPad 2 at the end of July, so I’ve only had my iPad 2 for about 3 weeks. I also have an iPhone 4, so picking up and using an iPad was effortless. Because of this, the iPad has set an awfully high bar in my mind.\n\nAfter spending a little less than 24 hours with my new 32GB HP TouchPad, here are my thoughts:\n\n### Pros\n\n* Palm/HP definitely got the packaging right. It’s the most Apple-like experience for any non-Apple product I’ve ever seen.\n\n* webOS is gorgeous, with an emphasis on black/charcoal colors, the [Prelude system font]({{% wayback \"http://www.fontbureau.com/blog/palm-pre-system-fonts/\" %}}), and high-quality iconography derived from the circle shape ([Palm owns the circle]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/01/own-a-shape\" %}})). If you believe (as I do) that a software environment should look as good as it works, webOS is fantastic.\n\n* The TouchPad hardware is nice to the eyes and the touch. It has a sturdy (although somewhat plastic-y) feel to it.\n\n* Neither Netflix nor Hulu are filtering the TouchPad’s user-agent string. Hulu seems to maintain a black list for devices (Hulu has to pro-actively block devices), while Netflix seems to maintain a white list for devices (Netflix has to pro-actively allow devices). While I can watch Hulu content on my TouchPad (which comes with Flash), I can’t watch Netflix content (which requires Silverlight).\n\n* The bezel/cards UI is awesome.\n\n* Built-in support for several third-party accounts, including Skype and Dropbox. While iOS (and Mac OS X Lion) also has this, webOS’s integration seems to go a lot deeper — specifically in being able to do a decent job of merging contacts together across the various services.\n\n* The Facebook app (developed by Palm) beats the pants off of the phone-only iOS Facebook app. The closest competitor available for the iPad is an app called [MyPad+]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mypad-for-facebook-twitter/id413419662\" %}}).\n\n* The Last.fm app is also designed for the TouchPad, easily beating the phone-only iOS Last.fm app.\n\n* The photo app has built-in support for Facebook photos and videos built right in.\n\n* The on-screen keyboard has digits as part of its first screen. You don’t need to tap `shift` to get to them.\n\n### Cons\n\n* It’s a lot heavier than my iPad 2.\n\n* The screen and iPhone 3G-ish style back attract fingerprints like its their job.\n\n* The UI doesn’t track finger movements as quickly as iOS, so the touch/scroll responsiveness feels laggy compared to the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.\n\n* Actually, the whole OS is a bit laggy. It’s as if it takes a moment to “spin-up” after I launch an application or switch from one screen to another.\n\n* The TouchPad uses a non-standard Mini-USB cable, so my cache of leftover cables from my BlackBerry Pearl days are still as useless to me as they’ve been since I upgraded to the iPhone.\n\n* It doesn’t seem to charge when connected to my computer, so I need to disconnect it, climb down underneath my desk, and plug it in to get it to charge.\n\n* Ever heard of BeatsAudio? It’s the technology that powers the [Beats by Dre]({{% wayback \"http://beatsbydre.com\" %}}) headphone that are so freaking awesome. Yeah, not feeling it here. The iPad 2 speakers are better.\n\n* The app selection is downright awful. All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., [Netflix]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" %}}), [Hulu]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hulu-plus/id376510438\" %}}), [Twitter]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271\" %}}), [Instapaper]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208\" %}}), [Flipboard]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284\" %}}) are nowhere to be found on the [HP App Catalog]({{% wayback \"http://h41112.www4.hp.com/promo/webos/us/en/apps.html\" %}}).\n\n* While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n\n* Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is *much* slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the [Browserscope]({{% wayback \"http://browserscope.org\" %}}) test suite for the past couple of *hours* and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n\n* The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see [Mail]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/mail.html\" %}})). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n\n* Syncing sucks. Even with the [HP Play]({{% wayback \"http://hpplay.com\" %}}) software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TouchPad.png\"\u003e}}\n\nI think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer ([early 2011 MacBook Pro]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/stats/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\" %}})), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire ~~store~~ catalog.\n\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\n\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s [Nintendo DSs]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/ds\" %}}) when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of [New Super Mario Bros.]({{% wayback \"http://mario.nintendo.com\" %}}) and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\n\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\n\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\n\n## Epilogue: Side-by-side Photos\n\nIn this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6074944167_fdb72ba8c9_z.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\nHere they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6075483254_7426a943d9.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\nHere is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6074943945_f33605a463.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\n(Photo credits: First photo by [HP/Palm]({{% wayback \"http://hpwebos.com\" %}}). Second and third photos by [Sebastiaan de With]({{% wayback \"http://blog.cocoia.com/2011/hp-webos-event-roundup/\" %}}). Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\n\n## Update: Micro-USB ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nThanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size *du jour* called [Micro USB]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/USB#Mini_and_Micro_connectors\" %}}). The TouchPad uses the *Micro-B* flavor, which is why my *Mini USB* cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\n\n## Update: Hulu ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nOver the past couple of days, [Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist]({{% wayback \"http://www.precentral.net/hulu-finally-blocks-touchpad-owners-watching-videos\" %}}). Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080274516_8044d5f9ab.jpg\" alt=\"Hulu blocks HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\n## Update: Preware ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nLast night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered [Preware]({{% wayback \"http://preware.org\" %}}). Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like [Cydia]({{% wayback \"http://cydia.saurik.com/\" %}}) and [Rock Your Phone]({{% wayback \"http://rockyourphone.com\" %}}) for [jailbroken]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking\" %}}) iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually [quite OK]({{% wayback \"https://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=org.preware.docs\" %}}) with this community).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080468630_62f02c07f3.jpg\" alt=\"Preware\"\u003e}}\n\nAs part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \"[Got a slow HP TouchPad? Here are 3 easy ways to speed it up.]({{% wayback \"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/got-a-slow-hp-touchpad-here-are-3-easy-ways-to-speed-it-up/\" %}})\" The first thing you learn is that webOS does a ton of logging in the background. While potentially useful for debugging, it also uses up a tremendous amount of system resources. The article discusses how to turn it off by enabling developer mode, installing Preware, and then installing a homebrew package that disables the logging. Also, if you’re interested in squeezing even more juice out of your TouchPad, the article also discusses how to overclock your TouchPad from 1.2 GHz to 1.5 GHz.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6079931607_b4aeaf598f.jpg\" alt=\"Govnah\"\u003e}}\n\nAnother article by John Biehler entitled \"[How to install Preware onto your HP TouchPad on a Mac]({{% wayback \"http://johnbiehler.com/2011/07/22/how-to-install-preware-onto-your-hp-touchpad-on-a-mac/\" %}})\" suggests a few other packages you can install to improve the general responsiveness of webOS on the TouchPad. There are a few others you can install to just make life a little simpler as well. I chose to install the following patches:\n\n* Advanced Reset Options\n* Faster Card Animations HYPER Version\n* Increase Touch Sensitivity and Smoothness 10\n* Just Charge By Default\n* Muffle System Logging\n* Private Browsing\n* Remove Tap Ripple\n* Unthrottle Download Manager\n\nThat last one is interesting. I had wondered why downloads seemed so slow on the TouchPad compared to my iOS devices. As it turns out, webOS throttles download speeds down to 64 kbps. Applying the patch to unthrottle the download manager sped up my TouchPad downloads *dramatically*.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080468320_835506aa1e.jpg\" alt=\"Speed Test\"\u003e}}\n"},

The main problem with this is using Software Update, as most Apple applications won’t update if they aren’t currently residing in their Apple-approved homes. In other words, Apple’s “application dump” style organization goes head-to-head with my neat-freak organization style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I decided to do the next best thing: Create a “Smart Applications” folder where I run all of my apps from, that I can keep organized however I want. I dumped all of my apps into the Applications folder, and all of my utilities into \u003ccode\u003e/Applications/Utilities\u003c/code\u003e.

I can, however, sync with [.Mac]({{% wayback \"http://www.mac.com\" %}}).\n\n## iSync 2\n\nBefore I got my new [Motorola v330 phone]({{% wayback \"http://direct.motorola.com/ENS/web_producthome.asp?Country=USA\u0026language=ENS\u0026productid=29544\" %}}), I just used iSync to occasionally sync my contacts and calendars to my iPod.\n\nAfter I got my phone, I found out that with a little hacking, iSync will support my new phone. I did the hackjob, and it worked. So, I synced all of the phone numbers between my computer and my phone. Problem was, I ended up with double numbers in my phone (as I already had many of my contacts in there), and nothing new in my Address Book.\n\nSo, I deleted all of the numbers in my phone and decided to start over fresh. Big mistake. Between the two devices, the most recent modified date was on my phone, so when I synced, I wiped out all of the phone numbers I had in my entire world. This was a sad, sad day. It toook me about 8 hours worth of phone calls and digging through my wife’s [Palm]() to get all of my numbers back. I finally realized that I had a month-old backup on my iPod, so I was able to pull most numbers from there. iSync saving me from iSync.\n\nNow, iSync and I are friends again. Couple that with [BluePhoneElite]({{% wayback \"http://www.reelintelligence.com/BluePhoneElite/\" %}}), and I’m a happy camper.\n\n## .Mac\n\nI had an iTools account back in 1999 or 2000. That expired back when Apple changed iTools to .Mac and started charging a subscription fee. Nowadays, I use this about 95% for syncing and about 5% for using the iDisk to exchange data between my personal PowerBook and my work PC.\n\n## QuickTime 7\n\nThe coolest thing about QuickTime 7 is the super-huge trailers available from the [HD QuickTime Gallery]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/\" %}}). Beyond that, the improvements are completely lost on me. It’s awesome to see fantastic clarity when I play an HD trailer in full-screen without it looking like crap.\n\n## Address Book\n\nAs with Panther, I use my Address Book constantly. It was a huge help when I wiped out all of my phone numbers (read the iSync section above). I created a set of Smart Groups that listed people in my Address Book that were (are) missing entries for phone number, address, IM name, etc., so I always know who I need to pester about getting information from.\n\n## Unified Theme\n\nI’m a big fan of OSX’s “Aqua” theme, paticularly Panther’s Aqua. On the other hand, I can’t stand “Brushed Metal”. I think it’s a horrible theme, and should be killed. So when Apple came up with the “Unified” theme (which I’ve referred to as “toolbar-in-titlebar” in the past), I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nUnified is basically a “smooth metal” version of Aqua. It takes the toned-down pinstripes of Panther, the multicolored close/minimize/resize buttons and throbbing blue buttons of Aqua, and combines it with a sleek metallic toolbar-in-title bar look. I think it’s fantastic, and I’m a big fan.\n\nI think that from here, Apple should add system-level theming — much like the feature of [Copland]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland\" %}}) that didn’t quite make it into [Tempo]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_8\" %}}), although all the architecture was already in place. The preference panel would allow users to choose whether they want Classic Aqua (Jaguar and older), New Aqua (Panther), Brushed Metal (iTunes and Safari), Pro (Apple’s Pro line of applications), or Unified (Tiger-style Aqua). This setting would persist across all applications in the OS, so that all apps would have a consistent look across the board (much like the UI consistency in Mac OS 9 or Windows XP).\n\nA good overview of the “many faces of Mac OS X” can be found at [Rob’s Observatory]({{% wayback \"http://www.robservatory.com/archives/2005/05/17/consistency-of-design/\" %}}).\n\n## System Performance\n\nTiger made my PowerBook feel snappier after the Simple Install I did, but it feels even faster after the Archive and Install I did two weeks ago. Beyond all Microsoftian comprehension, *Tiger runs faster on the same hardware compared to Panther*. How sweet is that?\n\n## Any Problems?\n\nJust two. Sometimes my phone doesn’t sync right unless I turn it off then back on again. I think that has more to do with the fact that my phone isn’t *officially* supported by iSync yet.\n\nThe second is that I can’t browse to my Windows SMB shares without locking up the Finder. I can connect via IP, but not by browsing to the share. I’m hoping that this will be fixed in 10.4.2 coming up this week or next.\n\n## What has Tiger enabled me to do over Panther?\n\n* Organize my apps and utilities more intelligently\n* Launch (almost) any app, (almost) straight from the desktop\n* Save myself from myself with iSync, .Mac, and Address Book\n* Save time and stay organized better by automating several repetitive tasks\n* Burn data CD’s faster\n* Sync devices and data easily and automatically\n* Watch full-screen trailers that actually look good full-screen\n* Surf the web at blazing speeds with incredible response time\n* Organize my email more intelligently\n* More stuff that I just can’t think of right now.\n\nAt this point, I’d say that any “laggards” that haven’t yet upgraded to Tiger should do so ASAP. Once you figure out how to make features like Spotlight and Automator work for you, you’ll be amazed by what all you can accomplish.\n"},

However, I did have the ClamAV software installed prior to upgrading to Tiger.\n\nVisiting the [ClamAV FAQ]({{% wayback \"http://www.clamav.net/faq.html\" %}}), I see the following:\n\n\u003e **How do I remove the clamav account from my MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?**\n\u003e\n\u003e The clamav user was set up by Apple and we don’t know anything about it.\n\u003e\n\u003e **What is the password for the clamav user on MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?**\n\u003e\n\u003e The clamav user was set up by Apple who has not told us the password they use, please contact Apple support for help. You may find that sudo password clamav in a terminal session helps to change the password, however we cannot support the option.\n\n## Windows SMB Sharing:\n\nI can still connect to my Windows shares by typing in the IP address, but using the browse utility causes Finder to hang and crash. That’s no good.\n\n## My Menubar Clock is in the Wrong Place:\n\nMinor annoyance, but annoying nonetheless.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/img/tiger_menubar.png\" alt=\"Tiger Menubar\"\u003e}}\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nSo that’s it! Overall my experience has been pretty positive. If you haven’t upgraded yet, and features like Spotlight and Dashboard aren’t compelling enough to upgrade at the moment, I’d say to wait until 10.4.1 or 10.4.2 comes out. Don’t get me wrong… you should definitely upgrade, but hopefully some of the minor quirks will be worked out in an upcoming point-release.\n"},
