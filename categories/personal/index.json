I’d been blogging since early 2003, and I simply didn’t have anything else to say.\n\nSince the last time I wrote, a few things have happened. First off, I quit my job last September to co-found my first startup, [Foleeo]({{% wayback \"http://foleeo.com\" %}}). We’ve been keeping our eyes on the web and watching what’s been going on. We’ve been looking at the successful players, and have learned from them. We’ve been listening to thoughts and ideas from many people in the blogosphere to get a sense of not only what some of the existing problems are, but also how people want them to be solved. We’re working on some really cool stuff and I really hope that people are as stoked about this stuff as I am when we start pushing out the cool parts of our roadmap.\n\n[Geoffrey]({{% wayback \"http://geoffers.uni.cc\" %}}) and I have released SimplePie Beta 3, and are trying to polish off our 1.0 release. SimplePie has really started to take off in popularity, garnering a TON of praise from the community. We couldn’t be more thrilled. It’s amazing to see how this little *side project within a project* has grown into a major player in the RSS/Atom space. This success would never have been possible without the community that has gathered around it to give feedback, submit patches, and make it better.\n\nAs a substitute for blogging (and as a simple showcase for SimplePie), I launched [RyanParman.com]({{% wayback \"http://ryanparman.com\" %}}) a few months ago as a way to show the world the things I was interested in without having to blog about them. The site keeps itself up-to-date by tapping into things I’m already doing — adding bookmarks, listening to iTunes, renting DVDs from Netflix, uploading photos to Flickr, watching funny videos on YouTube, and of course Twittering.\n\nSince this is my first official “comeback” post, I’ll be integrating this blog’s posts into that site as well. Lastly, I recently had a friend pass away at the age of 29. I have the quite unfortunate knowledge that she made the conscious decision to reject a relationship with the Lord, meaning that she hasn’t actually gone to a better place like we’d all hoped. If so, I’d be throwing a party for that lucky girl because she got there before I did! Instead, I find myself mourning in the very depths of my soul.\n\nBut it got me thinking. If I was visited by an angel who told me I had 30 days to live, how would I spend *today?* I know the setup might sound a little odd, but let me put it into perspective: If an angel came and told me, it’s not like I could argue about it — I would know it was coming. If I’ve got 30 days, it leaves me with enough time to do a little planning so I don’t have to panic and try to cram everything into today. And if I knew I didn’t have much time left, what would I spend those precious few moments doing? Who would I spend them with? Would I stay angry at those people? Would I still be afraid to call that old friend I had a falling-out with a few years ago? Would I make long-distance friendships a greater priority? It’s really had me thinking, and I’ve been making changes to my life and my schedule appropriately.\n\nAnyways, welcome back into the life of Ryan Parman. Hopefully I’ll be able to keep it interesting. :)\n"},

Unpacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally got my Windows PC desktop put together earlier this week, and began pulling TV shows from my Tivo so that they didn’t get deleted before I had a chance to watch them. I’m way behind on How I met your mother, Prison Break, House, Supernatural, Lost, Veronica Mars, Alias, Smallville, and NUMB3RS, although I did take a couple of hours last night to watch an episode each of Smallville and Prison Break. Excellent shows, by the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the point of the title of this post, I’ve moved from the heart of Silicon Valley to a small town about 1 hour 15 minutes (80 miles) away called Los Baños, which means “The Toilets” in Spanish — ’nuff said. Why on earth would I do such a thing? Three reasons, really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were able to get a lot more house for our money by moving to the armpit of California. In San Jose, we were looking at a run-down, 3 bed, 2 bath, 1-car garage, 1,500 sq. ft. condominium for $500k, or we could move to Los Baños and get a 5 bedroom, 3 bath, 3-car garage, 3,000 sq. ft. single-family home for the same price. This was a no-brainer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProperty values are skyrocketing in this little cow-town. People from Silicon Valley and the SF Bay area are moving further and further south as the area gets more crowded. Los Baños is the next town in line as more northerly towns are filling up — and the housing market is showing that. Our offer was accepted at $500k, but the appraisal came back at $525k before we’d even closed escrow. Now, someone down the street is selling a home that is 500 sq. ft. smaller than ours and they’re trying to get $570 for it. We could feasibly make $100-$150k on our home within the first 12–18 months. Schweet!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly was the location. And I don’t mean that I like the smell of the wonderful farm animals at 5:00am, but rather that I’m roughly 1.5 hours from work, 1.5 hours from my hometown of Fresno (and Clovis and Sanger where most of my friends still live), and just a few blocks from my parents and siblings. This is good for me, because I can spend time with the people I care most about without having to drive quite so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most important change, however, has been less a matter of commuting, moving, being half a million dollars further in debt, or any of the other major changes that have been going on — instead it’s been the little things that have been sticking out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCustomer Service:\u003c/strong\u003e Customer service is nearly always worse in a small town than in a bigger city because there tends to be less expected of them. Granted you can run into stupid people anywhere (and I run into lots of them, be sure of that), but small towns are especially bad. For example: I went to 4 stores this past weekend looking for these little plastic things that allow you to hook your coaxial or ethernet cables and nail them to the walls — a great way to run lots of wires and keep things looking clean. I went to Walmart, Kmart, Radio Shack, and the local hardware store. The cashiers at all 4 stores all told me either how much they hated their jobs, or that they wanted to go home, or apologized for having “garlic breath” — no kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDriving the Speed Limit:\u003c/strong\u003e I drive fast. Really fast. I have a lead foot, and a car that can keep up. I speed almost constantly, usually without even realizing it. But even if I don’t like it, I can’t complain if the person in front of me wants to drive the speed limit. There’s nothing wrong with that, and actually, it’s what I should be doing myself. But here’s the issue: In bigger cities, people typically drive 10–15 mph over the speed limit. In small towns, I frequently get stuck behind people going 10–15 mph _below_ the speed limit. ARGH! And I would totally speed up and go around them if I could, but the problem with that lies with number three…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBored Cops:\u003c/strong\u003e Cops in this town will find a reason to pull you over just to give themselves something to do. They’ll pull you over for speeding (even if you weren’t), badger you like you just ran over Mother Teresa, then let you off with a warning after wasting 15 minutes of your life that you can never get back thanks to this idiot cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can’t only complain about small towns, as there are some good things about them too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLos Baños has some of the best Mexican food ever.

Our escrow closed about three weeks ago, and we moved in two weeks ago. The last two weeks have been a blur as we unpack our boxes and move our furniture around. Except for times when I’m working, sleeping, or driving, I’ve been unpacking. That’s it. Unpacking.\nI finally got my Windows PC desktop put together earlier this week, and began pulling TV shows from my Tivo so that they didn’t get deleted before I had a chance to watch them. I’m way behind on How I met your mother, Prison Break, House, Supernatural, Lost, Veronica Mars, Alias, Smallville, and NUMB3RS, although I did take a couple of hours last night to watch an episode each of Smallville and Prison Break. Excellent shows, by the way.\nBack to the point of the title of this post, I’ve moved from the heart of Silicon Valley to a small town about 1 hour 15 minutes (80 miles) away called Los Baños, which means “The Toilets” in Spanish — ’nuff said. Why on earth would I do such a thing? Three reasons, really.\n  We were able to get a lot more house for our money by moving to the armpit of California. In San Jose, we were looking at a run-down, 3 bed, 2 bath, 1-car garage, 1,500 sq. ft. condominium for $500k, or we could move to Los Baños and get a 5 bedroom, 3 bath, 3-car garage, 3,000 sq. ft. single-family home for the same price. This was a no-brainer.\n  Property values are skyrocketing in this little cow-town. People from Silicon Valley and the SF Bay area are moving further and further south as the area gets more crowded. Los Baños is the next town in line as more northerly towns are filling up — and the housing market is showing that. Our offer was accepted at $500k, but the appraisal came back at $525k before we’d even closed escrow. Now, someone down the street is selling a home that is 500 sq. ft. smaller than ours and they’re trying to get $570 for it. We could feasibly make $100-$150k on our home within the first 12–18 months. Schweet!\n  Lastly was the location. And I don’t mean that I like the smell of the wonderful farm animals at 5:00am, but rather that I’m roughly 1.5 hours from work, 1.5 hours from my hometown of Fresno (and Clovis and Sanger where most of my friends still live), and just a few blocks from my parents and siblings. This is good for me, because I can spend time with the people I care most about without having to drive quite so far.\n  The most important change, however, has been less a matter of commuting, moving, being half a million dollars further in debt, or any of the other major changes that have been going on — instead it’s been the little things that have been sticking out to me.\n  Customer Service: Customer service is nearly always worse in a small town than in a bigger city because there tends to be less expected of them. Granted you can run into stupid people anywhere (and I run into lots of them, be sure of that), but small towns are especially bad. For example: I went to 4 stores this past weekend looking for these little plastic things that allow you to hook your coaxial or ethernet cables and nail them to the walls — a great way to run lots of wires and keep things looking clean. I went to Walmart, Kmart, Radio Shack, and the local hardware store. The cashiers at all 4 stores all told me either how much they hated their jobs, or that they wanted to go home, or apologized for having “garlic breath” — no kidding.\n  Driving the Speed Limit: I drive fast. Really fast. I have a lead foot, and a car that can keep up. I speed almost constantly, usually without even realizing it. But even if I don’t like it, I can’t complain if the person in front of me wants to drive the speed limit. There’s nothing wrong with that, and actually, it’s what I should be doing myself. But here’s the issue: In bigger cities, people typically drive 10–15 mph over the speed limit. In small towns, I frequently get stuck behind people going 10–15 mph _below_ the speed limit. ARGH! And I would totally speed up and go around them if I could, but the problem with that lies with number three…\n  Bored Cops: Cops in this town will find a reason to pull you over just to give themselves something to do. They’ll pull you over for speeding (even if you weren’t), badger you like you just ran over Mother Teresa, then let you off with a warning after wasting 15 minutes of your life that you can never get back thanks to this idiot cop.\n  But I can’t only complain about small towns, as there are some good things about them too.\n  Los Baños has some of the best Mexican food ever. Granted, most of the residents of the town are of Hispanic descent.

Besides the new features that I talked about the last time I mentioned Tarzan here, I’ve added the ability to apply custom descriptions to items via the Control Panel, and I’ve also added advanced cache management options — specifically the ability to recache the image/data for a given item without having to FTP into your cache folder and try to discern which item is which. I’ve also begun building the API that will allow people to search for items based on keyword rather than just ASIN/ISBN numbers. It should also be noted that I’ve completely overhauled the [caching system](/archives/000404.php) in Tarzan 1.2, and you’d have to be Forrest Gump to not notice the significant speed gains that this new system has allowed. This same caching system (as well as a few other Tarzan features) will be making it’s way into the next version of [SimplePie](/projects/simplepie/) as well as [Simple PHP Gallery 2]({{% wayback \"http://www.relativelyabsolute.com/spg/\" %}}) in the upcoming months.\n\nOkay, I’m done writing now. I think it’s time to take my frozen peas into the living room to try to finish up [Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-1699\u0026\" %}})\n"},

A man can spend a lifetime with a woman and never pause to look into her soul.\n\u003e\n\u003e And a person can be all that goodness calls him to be and still never see the Author of life.\n\u003e\n\u003e Being honest or moral or even religious doesn’t necessarily mean we will see him. No. We may see what others see in him. Or we may hear what some say he said. But until we see him for ourselves, until our own sight is given, we may think we see him, having in reality seen only a hazy form in the gray semidarkness.\n\u003e\n\u003e Have you seen him?\n\u003e\n\u003e Have you caught a glimpse of His Majesty? A word is placed in a receptive crevice of your heart that causes you, ever so briefly, to see his face. You hear a verse read in a tone you’d never heard, or explained in a way you’d never thought, and one more piece of the puzzle falls into place. Someone touches your painful spirit as only one sent from him could do… and there he is.\n\u003e\n\u003e Jesus.\n\u003e\n\u003e The man. The bronzed Galilean who spoke with such thunderous authority and loved with such childlike humility.\n\u003e\n\u003e The God. The one who claimed to be older than time and greater than death.\n\u003e\n\u003e Gone is the pomp of religion; dissipated is the fog of theology. Momentarily lifted is the opaque curtain of controversy and opinion. Erased are our own blinding errors and egotism. And there he stands.\n\u003e\n\u003e Jesus.\n\u003e\n\u003e Have you seen him?\n\nAnd he is the reason why we celebrate. How awesome a friend he is. And when a fantastically awesome friend of yours has a birthday, you want to celebrate in his honor. And that is what Christmas is about. Not about capitalism, and whining kids, or even about the tree and the lights, but about the birthday of Jesus Christ, the one true living God.\n\nHe is truly great, and that’s why we celebrate this season every year. I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas, and that you all remember that beyond the tinsel, lights, and presents, it all comes down to Christ.\n"},

        "source":"\nThings have been rather hecktic lately. I recently moved into a new apartment, I had my [car accident](/archives/000191.php), and I started a brand-new job all in a span of a week and a half.\n\nI’m still getting used to my new job. I have to take the train to get to work and back everyday, and it has so far proven to be less than reliable (it took 2.5 hours to move 45 miles last Friday). I’ve been keeping up decently with the [blogs I read](/blogs/) over the last few weeks, particularly SxSW this weekend (I hope I can go next year), but I’m still unpacking my stuff, and am still waiting on the delivery of my new computer desk which is now two weeks late (I’ll never shop [Office Max]({{% wayback \"http://www.officemax.com/\" %}}) again).\n\nSo, my ever-so-exciting [upcoming redesign](/archives/000181.php) has been on the back burner for longer than I’ve wanted it to be. I also haven’t had time to complete and release the updates to [Blocker](/projects/blocker/) I had been working on, nor have I had the time to do any more work on [Feed Parser](/projects/feedparser/). Grrr… I don’t like falling behind on projects.\n\nI’m also working on a easier-to-use version of my blogroll system. Currently it’s just kinda hacked together, but I’m working on a version that would be easy for anyone to just start using.

So when I start to snore, I’ll wake myself up.
