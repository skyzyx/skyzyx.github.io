I’ve decided to rename my blog “Flailing Wildly” because I think it fits me pretty well, and it sounds better than “Skyzyx.com”. I’m also wanting to move to something more professional sounding that covers any domain name I may want to have, so “Skyzyx.com” is now officially “Skyzyx Technologies”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those who don’t know, I started working on my website’s redesign about a year and a half ago. After several months of development, my hard drive fried, and I lost nearly everything. This was rather discouraging, and as such I didn’t get around to beginning development fresh until April-ish of this year. I got Wordpress installed (I love the 5 minute install), exported the then-current entries, and imported everything into Wordpress… no problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge part of this redesign is an overhaul of the information architecture. This site has grown far beyond what I had initially anticipated, and I was still using 2 year old IA. So, I began organizing my categories as much as possible, and placing posts in multiple categories, where appropriate. About 2 months ago, I started getting 500 errors in Movable Type. This had less to do with Movable Type, and more to do with a bug in the latest release of CPanel, which is what my other webhost uses (for now… I’m switching hosts for \u003ccode\u003e.com\u003c/code\u003e this month). Anyways, I couldn’t login anymore, which meant that I couldn’t export my posts from Movable Type anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo last night I had an epiphany. Log onto my \u003ccode\u003e.com\u003c/code\u003e server, backup my Movable Type database, install Movable Type on my \u003ccode\u003e.net\u003c/code\u003e server, import the database backup, and use the MT interface to do a formal export, which I then imported back into Wordpress. The whole thing took about 15 minutes to accomplish, after spending the last two months frustrated over the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I’m moving Skyzyx.com to the same host that I have Skyzyx.net at: Dreamhost. Dreamhost is freakin’ awesome, and that’s all I have to say about that. Anyways, all of the content that is currently at Skyzyx.com will still exist once my dual-site strategy goes live. Skyzyx.com will be the home of all things professional: my resume, projects like SimplePie and Tarzan that could almost be considered “Products”, and things like Web Building Resources and such. Things that are a little more static, and don’t need to be updated as often. Skyzyx.net will be more personal and experimental in nature. This is where my weblog will live, along with experimental software, CVS repositories, etc. This is the plan today, anyways. Or I might simply have any address at Skyzyx.com redirect to the same files Skyzyx.net, or vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I’m back. I was never dead, I was just trying to balance fixing my website, caring for my new son, and figuring out how to develop JSTL-based, Ajax-enabled portlets for Oracle Portal (at work). Things are coming along. Expect lots and lots and lots of changes while I get used to this Wordpress thing, figure out how to build my own design, and generally get this forever-old redesign out and ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Keep it up!\n\nHappy 2004 to everyone. May the new year bring you joy, happiness, and the correct year on all of your checks. God bless!\n\nP.S. One of the sites I must say I’m looking forward to in 2004 is the one from David House. According to [comments he’s made]({{% wayback \"http://www.9rules.com/whitespace/our_thoughts/goals_for_2004.php#comments\" %}}) he’ll probably have a website up sometime in the spring. We read and comment on many of the same blogs, and we both participate frequently on [Coding Forums]({{% wayback \"http://www.codingforums.com\" %}}). From what I’ve seen from him so far (pre-website), I’m expecting many good things to come from him. Watch the design community for his name in the upcoming months: David House. =)\n"},
