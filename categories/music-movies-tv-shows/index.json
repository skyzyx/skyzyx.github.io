Night had the job of packing nearly 8 hours worth of source material into a 2 hour movie. But rather than pulling out the most interesting parts of the first season and trying to create a worthy film portrayal that was true to the characters and storyline, it seems that he opted for simply taking the entire season on DVD and pressing the fast-forward button on the remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe backstory is pretty much non-existent for much of the film. Some storytellers will introduce parts of the backstory through flash-backs; some will have the backstory come out as part of the natural progression of the characters so that the audience can figure out how we got here. The backstory was barely glossed over as exposition, and not even good exposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/airbender_iceberg.webp\" alt=\"The Last Airbender\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/airbender_iceberg.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Airbender\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pilot episode, “\u003ca href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/The_Boy_in_the_Iceberg\"\u003eThe Boy in the Iceberg\u003c/a\u003e,” there is an extended intro where Katara narrates the backstory of how the 4 elemental nations lived in peace and harmony until the day the \u003ca href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Nation\"\u003eFire Nation\u003c/a\u003e attacked. It tells of how the \u003ca href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar\"\u003eAvatar\u003c/a\u003e — master of all four elements — vanished 100 years ago, and in that time, most people came to believe that he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn episode or two later, we learn that the Avatar is re-incarnated into the next elemental nation in sequence — this time it was Aang, an Airbender. Before him was \u003ca href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Roku\"\u003eAvatar Roku\u003c/a\u003e, a Firebender. The film barely touches on these fundamentally key plot points, which leaves any semi-intelligent movie-goer somewhat confused by what’s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poor pacing of the movie made the whole story feel very jerky. The movie clocked in at an hour and forty minutes, culminating in a battle of good vs. evil at the \u003ca href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Northern_Water_Tribe\"\u003eNorthern Water Tribe\u003c/a\u003e. The last 40 minutes were spent on what was essentially 4 out of 20 episodes worth of material. Interesting and important plot points throughout were skipped, but as long as we got some awesome CG effects, that would make up for it, right? Wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, M. Night had done such a poor job of developing the characters and the backstory that I didn’t really care who won as long as I knew I would be out of my misery soon. 20 minutes from the end, I nearly fell asleep. Once the credits began to roll, I nearly tramped an old woman while trying to get out of the theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"characters\"\u003eCharacters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t believe that M. Night has seen a single episode of \u003cem\u003eAvatar: The Last Airbender\u003c/em\u003e. Okay, maybe one or two — but certainly not the entire series. If he had, he’d know that the most important element of the show was the characters and the relationships that they formed over 3 seasons. Neither the writing nor the actors provided an accurate portrayal of the characters we’ve come to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/airbender_characters.webp\" alt=\"The Last Airbender\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/airbender_characters.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Airbender\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAang\u003c/em\u003e is a 12-year-old boy that is generally playful and fun. He cares very deeply for his friends, and would do anything for them. But Aang is also very reflective about his place in the world. Being the Avatar, he’s very respectful of his lineage, and spends a lot of time in self-discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSokka\u003c/em\u003e is the comedy relief. He always knows the wrong thing to say at the wrong time, and is great at drawing the wrong conclusion from his experiences. Being the eldest, however, he carries a certain weight in wanting to protect his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKatara\u003c/em\u003e is motherly and nurturing, and has a certain insight and sensitivity that helps Aang along the way. When Sokka is telling bad jokes, and Aang is reflecting on what it means to be the Avatar, Katara is making sure that the bonds of their friendship stay strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eZuko\u003c/em\u003e, the prince of the Fire Nation, is a tormented soul. Never able to earn the love and respect of his father, Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation by his father. The only way for Zuko to regain his honor is to capture the Avatar and bring him back home to the Fire Nation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are the characters of the \u003cem\u003eAirbender\u003c/em\u003e universe. With the exception of \u003ca href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/dev-patel/\"\u003eDev Patel\u003c/a\u003e who had a barely-adequate performance as Prince Zuko, the rest of the characters might as well have been made out of cotton balls and popsicle sticks. No chemistry, no character development, no emotion, and totally wrong character traits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn particular, I felt that casting \u003ca href=\"https://letterboxd.com/actor/jackson-rathbone/\"\u003eJackson Rathbone\u003c/a\u003e as Sokka was a huge mistake. Not only was he incredibly stiff and humorless throughout the film, but his inability to show any sort of emotion toward either his sister or the northern water princess provides nothing more than a devastatingly awkward and abysmal performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"quotes\"\u003eQuotes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink I may be over-reacting?

        "plain":"The Last Airbender is an abomination to film making. It makes Matrix Revolutions look like The Godfather. Don’t go see it, tell your friends not to see it — don’t even wait until it comes out on DVD. Don’t waste a moment of your life on this film; you’ll thank me later.   I love Avatar I am a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender. When I was out of work for a few weeks in 2005, I happened to land on this Nickelodeon cartoon while channel surfing. The depth of the universe, the chemistry between the characters, and the fact that it had something for both kids and adults simply mesmerized me. I was astounded that the writing for an animated cartoon could be so good.\nOver the next few years, I watched Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko, Ihro, Appa and little Momo grow together as a family, and saw Aang grow from being the boy in the iceberg to a fully-realized master of all four elements. The build-up to the finale kept me on the edge of my seat, and the final battle between Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Ozai was simply epic! When the story ended, there was closure for all of the characters. Although I knew I was going to miss the show, I was happy that it ended on a high note.\nExpectations When I heard that M. Night Shyamalan was going to make a live-action Airbender film, I was both excited and worried. Very few re-makes have done their originals justice. Superman Returns, Spider-man, [The Incredible] Hulk, Transformers — I’m looking at you.\nYou guys weren’t very good, and I wasn’t expecting much from you. Notable exceptions are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jurassic Park and the Harry Potter films. While not perfect, these re-makes did an admirable job at standing up on behalf of the source material. Even the Bourne trilogy, which notoriously deviated from the books, was at least a great set of movies.\n  Despite M. Night being pretty hit-or-miss over the last decade, I still considered myself a fan. Luke Y. Thompson, E! Online, described M. Night as:\n “Director M. Night Shyamalan is, of course, best known for slow-burn, low-key suspense films that end with dramatic twists.”\n If you’re familiar with Airbender, you’ll know that its story doesn’t fit the typical M. Night criteria. The Sixth Sense, Signs and The Village were all good flicks; Unbreakable and The Happening were so-so; Lady in the Water was unbearably boring. So which way was this re-make of one of my favorite TV shows going to go? Luke Thompson goes on to say:\n “And that probably makes him exactly the wrong person for a would-be epic like this adaptation of the popular animated serial Avatar: The Last Airbender.”\n Of course, I hadn’t read this review before I saw the movie. I did, however, see a quick quote from the Roger Ebert review:\n “The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. The laws of chance suggest that something should have gone right. Not here. It puts a nail in the coffin of low-rent 3D, but it will need a lot more coffins than that.”\n Sometimes Ebert is right; sometimes he’s wrong. I figured I’d take my chances. I was horribly, horribly wrong.\nStory and pacing Listed on IMDb as the sole screenwriter for the film, M. Night had the job of packing nearly 8 hours worth of source material into a 2 hour movie. But rather than pulling out the most interesting parts of the first season and trying to create a worthy film portrayal that was true to the characters and storyline, it seems that he opted for simply taking the entire season on DVD and pressing the fast-forward button on the remote.\nThe backstory is pretty much non-existent for much of the film. Some storytellers will introduce parts of the backstory through flash-backs; some will have the backstory come out as part of the natural progression of the characters so that the audience can figure out how we got here. The backstory was barely glossed over as exposition, and not even good exposition.\n  In the pilot episode, “The Boy in the Iceberg,” there is an extended intro where Katara narrates the backstory of how the 4 elemental nations lived in peace and harmony until the day the Fire Nation attacked. It tells of how the Avatar — master of all four elements — vanished 100 years ago, and in that time, most people came to believe that he was dead.\nAn episode or two later, we learn that the Avatar is re-incarnated into the next elemental nation in sequence — this time it was Aang, an Airbender. Before him was Avatar Roku, a Firebender. The film barely touches on these fundamentally key plot points, which leaves any semi-intelligent movie-goer somewhat confused by what’s going on.\nThe poor pacing of the movie made the whole story feel very jerky. The movie clocked in at an hour and forty minutes, culminating in a battle of good vs. evil at the Northern Water Tribe. The last 40 minutes were spent on what was essentially 4 out of 20 episodes worth of material. Interesting and important plot points throughout were skipped, but as long as we got some awesome CG effects, that would make up for it, right? Wrong.\nUnfortunately, M. Night had done such a poor job of developing the characters and the backstory that I didn’t really care who won as long as I knew I would be out of my misery soon. 20 minutes from the end, I nearly fell asleep. Once the credits began to roll, I nearly tramped an old woman while trying to get out of the theater.\nCharacters I don’t believe that M. Night has seen a single episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Okay, maybe one or two — but certainly not the entire series. If he had, he’d know that the most important element of the show was the characters and the relationships that they formed over 3 seasons. Neither the writing nor the actors provided an accurate portrayal of the characters we’ve come to know.\n  Aang is a 12-year-old boy that is generally playful and fun. He cares very deeply for his friends, and would do anything for them. But Aang is also very reflective about his place in the world. Being the Avatar, he’s very respectful of his lineage, and spends a lot of time in self-discovery.\nSokka is the comedy relief. He always knows the wrong thing to say at the wrong time, and is great at drawing the wrong conclusion from his experiences. Being the eldest, however, he carries a certain weight in wanting to protect his friends.\nKatara is motherly and nurturing, and has a certain insight and sensitivity that helps Aang along the way. When Sokka is telling bad jokes, and Aang is reflecting on what it means to be the Avatar, Katara is making sure that the bonds of their friendship stay strong.\nZuko, the prince of the Fire Nation, is a tormented soul. Never able to earn the love and respect of his father, Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation by his father. The only way for Zuko to regain his honor is to capture the Avatar and bring him back home to the Fire Nation.\nThese are the characters of the Airbender universe. With the exception of Dev Patel who had a barely-adequate performance as Prince Zuko, the rest of the characters might as well have been made out of cotton balls and popsicle sticks. No chemistry, no character development, no emotion, and totally wrong character traits.\nIn particular, I felt that casting Jackson Rathbone as Sokka was a huge mistake. Not only was he incredibly stiff and humorless throughout the film, but his inability to show any sort of emotion toward either his sister or the northern water princess provides nothing more than a devastatingly awkward and abysmal performance.\nQuotes Think I may be over-reacting? Here’s what others had to say:\n “After waiting extremely eagerly for this movie, I sat in the theater and was extremely eager for it to END. Ear-oh? Oong? Soak-ah?! Could they have butchered the names anymore than they did? Worse, the entire movie felt like a string of clips put together for an hour and a half and not like a movie at all.” — Tamisura\n  “So where did this movie go wrong? The better question would be: where didn’t it go wrong? The writing was horrendous. High school freshmen could probably manage to come up with a better screenplay. I’m not sure who gave Shyamalan permission to write this film, but whoever it was needs to formally apologize to the fans and to the people who wasted their money hoping to see something worthwhile.”— LunaRaven\n  “Void-ness of emotional moments are what really plague this film. I would blame this on the script but the performances are what make it not work. Every actor in this film (minus Shaun Toub delivers dialogue as if they were reading it for the very first time. Not one thing anyone says carries any weight, none of it resonates emotionally. To say the actors suffer from wooden acting would be insult an to wood.” — lukeg37\n And lastly, my favorite:\n “Just saw this, I don’t know what to call it. It was the only movie I’ve seen where everyone in the theater booed at the end and threw things at the screen. I feel like it was written by someone who can’t read, write or care about their or anyone else’s work. How do you take something that seemed like such a good idea and make it so terrible. I hope that the man or men responsible for this never get work again. This is what I would hope qualifies as a career killer, because I wish I had slept instead of going to this movie. I want my money, time, and expectations back. As in I expected at least good fun with the ‘bending’ or fight/dance scenes. I feel like I just got served… Do not watch or let ANYONE YOU KNOW GO TO THIS MOVIE, AND SOMEONE SHOULD PETITION TO CANCEL THE OTHER TWO.” — Partofthevoid\n I’ll wrap things up with a quote from Ty Burr, staff writer for the Boston Globe:\n “It would be heartening to report that Shyamalan has wrangled a good movie out of this litany of disaster, but no such luck. “The Last Airbender” is dreadful, an incomprehensible fantasy-action epic that makes the 2007 film “The Golden Compass”… look like a four-star classic.”\n M. Night Shyamalan was once one of my favorite writer-directors, but I’ve had enough. In the end I’ve decided to vote with my wallet. I’ll never pay to see another M. Night movie again.\n",

Since the format is so limited (along with any sort of “legal” (read: DRM’d) movie downloads from an online store), how on earth does it make sense to charge *more* for it? It doesn’t, and that’s why the format is failing.\n\nIt isn’t because it’s a bad idea — it’s actually a very good idea — but they need to drop the cost to 50% of the price of a DVD. Seriously, if most DVDs are around $17–$22, then they should sell the UMDs at $8-$12. Paying $30 for a 10-year-old movie is completely out of the question.\n\nSony (and all other movie companies), if you’re not willing to drop your prices on your UMD movies, then it’s definitely time for the format to go the way of the Aibo, Mini-Disc, BetaMax, ImageStation, Connect Music Store, and all of the “iPod Killers” you guys have had in the past.\n"},

Night Shayamalan flick. A woman and her children have just moved into a house that seems to be haunted. Her children are photosensitive (allergic to light), and someone keeps opening the curtains in the rooms. The “help” (the maid, the yards keeper, and their daughter) seem to have an intimate knowledge of the house, and seem to be keeping something secret. This isn’t the typical Hollywood “gotcha” horror/suspense flick, it’s very involved and leaves a lot to the imagination, which is what makes this movie so much better than the same ol’, same ol’ crap that tends to be in this genre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: B\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory\"\u003eCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, I need to explain that you should not compare this movie to the original “Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory”. This is a different movie that has its own merits, and if you try to compare it to something it’s not, then you’ll naturally be disappointed. Tim Burton is a brilliant director who gives this film a standard Burton feel. The cinematography is all about the darker feel, the “film noir” contrast of dark and light, and the feeling of creepiness as you go through the chocolate factory tour. Gene Wilder (in the original) was a gleeful, excitable Wonka who teetered on the edge of insanity. Johnny Depp is a creepy, schizoid Wonka who doesn’t like children much, and who has issues that stem from his father being an overprotective dentist. The original was a movie for the whole family, while this remake is a movie for adults and teens who are old enough to understand the darker feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: B+\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-constant-gardener\"\u003eThe Constant Gardener\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t even heard of this movie before the day I was listening to the Ebert and Roeper podcast, and they gave the film two enthusiastic thumbs up. Usually, I have to give their thumbs a few grains of salt, although they’re usually pretty good at separating the good films from the typical Hollywood garbage. The Constant Gardener is about a British ambassador and his wife who go to Africa to help those in need. 10 minutes into the movie, she is murdered, and her husband starts digging around to find out why she was killed. At first he thinks that she was cheating on him, but as we go through the movie, he discovers that she was fighting the Pharmaceutical companies and the unethical tests they were doing on the African people, and only falls more in love with her as he realizes the strength and passion she had. This is a very well-made movie that is also very depressing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, but it’s the kind of movie you only see once (much like A Beautiful Mind with Russell Crowe).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: A-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-40-year-old-virgin\"\u003eThe 40 Year Old Virgin\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve Carell gives a brilliant performance as a man who reaches his 40th birthday and has never had sex. He reminds me of the teenager who has never had it, and didn’t think he could get it, so he just gave up the fight. He’s got toy figurines from all kinds of movies and TV shows completely covering the inside of his apartment, he rides his bike everywhere he goes, and he just has that dopey ignorance about sex that teenagers have before they’ve ever done anything. One night when he reluctantly accepts an invitation to play poker with the guys, they start talking about some of their sexual escapades. When it gets to Andy (Steve Carell), he begins uncomfortably describing some details about “this one girl”, including the fact that her breasts felt wonderful like two big bags of sand. It’s at this point where his friends realize that Andy’s awkward behavior isn’t because he’s a serial killer, but rather because he’s a virgin. The point in every romantic comedy where something happens, the guy and the girl get in a fight, and it takes some sort of romantic action to bring them back together again is also here, except that it just doesn’t feel right. You kinda hit a moment of “Star Wars logic”, where the pieces don’t quite fit together, but they went with it anyways. This movie is less about American Pie-style sex gags, and more about romance and waiting for marriage before having sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: A-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"red-eye\"\u003eRed Eye\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I heard that this movie was done by Wes Craven, I started likening the film to Scream, where the first 10 minutes is really, really good, and then it becomes a typical Hollywood “formula” movie.

A girl is on her way home on a last-minute flight, her flight is delayed, she meets a guy, they hit it off, they end up sitting next to each other on the plane, he jokes about being an assassin, and then tells her he’s serious.

        "plain":"Every summer, I usually do a write-up of all of the movies I went to go see when I was on vacation. This year, however, I didn’t go on vacation, as this was the summer when my son was born. That, and I’m a contractor right now at my current job, so I don’t get all the benefits that include vacation time.\nSo this year, I’m going to write about the movies that I was able to see any time at all throughout the summer (they were rather sparse), and one of them was already on DVD. Let’s begin.\nThe Others The movie started out a little slow, and some of the characters were quite strange, but the ending has a twist worthy of a M. Night Shayamalan flick. A woman and her children have just moved into a house that seems to be haunted. Her children are photosensitive (allergic to light), and someone keeps opening the curtains in the rooms. The “help” (the maid, the yards keeper, and their daughter) seem to have an intimate knowledge of the house, and seem to be keeping something secret. This isn’t the typical Hollywood “gotcha” horror/suspense flick, it’s very involved and leaves a lot to the imagination, which is what makes this movie so much better than the same ol’, same ol’ crap that tends to be in this genre.\nBottom Line: B\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory First off, I need to explain that you should not compare this movie to the original “Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory”. This is a different movie that has its own merits, and if you try to compare it to something it’s not, then you’ll naturally be disappointed.

I believe that self-contained episodes plays a large role in this. Also with the whole one-mission-at-a-time thing, this season feels very slow by comparison.

Stiffler and Finch end up going after the same girl (Michelle’s virgin cousin), and Stiffler ends up eating dog crap, winning a dance contest in a gay/trans bar, and having sex with Jim’s strict jewish grandmother. The movie seemed to focus a lot more on Stiffler than anyone else. I was kinda irritated at Michelle’s cousin’s attitude towards the sacredness of sex. Also I didn’t like how the screenwriters just wrote out the other characters. There was no “oh, this person moved to Japan, and this person is in Jail”. Nope, they just didn’t exist anymore.

No, there weren’t any crazy action sequences or anything, but the movie was good overall. A mother and daughter bicker and argue all the time over things that teenagers and their parents argue over. They go to a chinese restaurant for dinner, and open fortune cookies at the same time that both of them say “You wouldn’t last one day in my life…”. Of course, this makes them switch places until they both do something selfless for each other. It’s funny watching a 15 year old act 40, and a 40 year old act 15. Although the teenager vs parent dynamic is a bit over the top (and obviously written from a parent’s point-of-view), I’d say catch the matinee showing and take your kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBottom Line: B\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bad-boys-ii\"\u003eBad Boys II\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Smith and Martin Lawrence play police officers for the city of Miami (read: Will Smith in Miami).

Namely, one particular ex-girlfriend, whose thought makes me want to unleash an adrenaline-fueled fury of primal rage.\n\nAnyways, here are sections of lyrics of some of the songs that stand out to me:\n\n\u003e **DON’T STAY**\\\n\u003e  Don’t stay.\\\n\u003e  Forget our memories,\\\n\u003e  Forget our possibilities,\\\n\u003e  Take all your faithlessness with you,\\\n\u003e  Just give me myself back,\\\n\u003e  And don’t stay.\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  I don’t need you anymore,\\\n\u003e  I don’t want to be ignored.\\\n\u003e  I don’t need one more day.\\\n\u003e  Of you wasting me away\\\n\u003e  …with no apologies.\\\n\n\u003e **SOMEWHERE I BELONG**\\\n\u003e  I want to heal, I want to feel\\\n\u003e  What I thought was never real\\\n\u003e  I want to let go of the pain I’ve held so long\\\n\u003e  Erase all the pain ’til it’s gone\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  I want to heal, I want to feel\\\n\u003e  Like I’m close to something real\\\n\u003e  I want to find something I’ve wanted all along\\\n\u003e  Somewhere I belong\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  I will never know myself until I do this on my own\\\n\u003e  And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed\\\n\u003e  I will never be anything ’til I break away from me\\\n\u003e  And I will break away, I’ll find myself today.\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  I want to heal, I want to feel,\\\n\u003e  …like I’m somewhere I belong.\\\n\n\u003e **FAINT**\\\n\u003e  I am a little bit insecure,\\\n\u003e  A little unconfident.\\\n\u003e  ’Cause you don’t understand\\\n\u003e  I do what I can,\\\n\u003e  But sometimes I don’t make sense.\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  I am what you never want to say,\\\n\u003e  But I’ve never had a doubt\\\n\u003e  It’s like no matter what I do\\\n\u003e  I can’t convince you\\\n\u003e  For once just to hear me out.\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  I can’t feel the way I did before.\\\n\u003e  Don’t turn your back on me,\\\n\u003e  I won’t be ignored.\\\n\u003e  Time won’t heal this damage anymore.\\\n\u003e  Don’t turn your back on me,\\\n\u003e  I won’t be ignored.\\\n\u003e \\\n\u003e  No! Hear me out now.\\\n\u003e  You’re gonna listen to me,\\\n\u003e  Like it or not…\\\n\u003e  Right now.\\\n\n"},
