Made by the same studio who did \u003cem\u003eHeavy Rain\u003c/em\u003e, it was like watching a really long movie — except that you would control the main character from time to time to interact with elements in the environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re interested in a really good \u003cem\u003egame\u003c/em\u003e with lots of action, this might not be for you.

I’m a big fan of games with a good story, and this one had me on the edge of my seat a few times. Couple that with really solid gameplay, and this makes for an excellent game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara Croft was voice-acted by \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082846/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2569832/\"\u003eCamilla Luddington\u003c/a\u003e, and the game offers a good arrangement of weapons and upgrades for the character. While the puzzles in the game aren’t quite like something you’d find in a \u003cem\u003eZelda\u003c/em\u003e game, there was still plenty of thinking and stealth involved as you moved to solve the mystery of the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"3-the-last-of-ushttpswebarchiveorgweb20140111082846httpwwwthelastofusplaystationcom-playstation-3\"\u003e3. \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082846/http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com\"\u003eThe Last of Us\u003c/a\u003e (Playstation 3)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082846/http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Last of Us\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e is set 20 years after a zombie outbreak. The main character, Joel, is not the same man now that he was when he lost his daughter on the first night of the outbreak. Now a smuggler, he is tasked with delivering a package to a group of freedom fighters outside of the police-state-like quarantine zone.

But it isn’t just old-school Mario stuff; You also get to see many of the things from the Wii and DS-era Mario games (e.g., \u003cem\u003eNew Super Mario Bros.\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSuper Mario 3D Land\u003c/em\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody knows that, with rare exception, the best games for any Nintendo console are the first-party games.

U\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eZelda: Wind Waker HD\u003c/em\u003e), I wasn’t sure that the game would be worth the cost. I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuper Mario 3D World is one of the most \u003cem\u003efun\u003c/em\u003e games I’ve played in recent memory, and although I’m still working my way through it, everything about it has been an absolute delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-bioshock-infinitehttpswebarchiveorgweb20140111082846httpwwwbioshockinfinitecom-xbox-360\"\u003e1. \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082846/http://www.bioshockinfinite.com\"\u003eBioshock Infinite\u003c/a\u003e (Xbox 360)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082846/http://www.bioshockinfinite.com\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eBioshock Infinite\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e was my very first game in the \u003cem\u003eBioshock\u003c/em\u003e series (I’m currently playing through the first Bioshock now), and I must say — \u003cem\u003eMIND BLOWN\u003c/em\u003e. From the prologue, to the twisted alternate universe, to the weapons and gameplay, to that mindf**k of an ending, \u003cem\u003eBioshock Infinite\u003c/em\u003e is my favorite game of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving gone back and played the original Bioshock after-the-fact, I can appreciate the improvements they’ve made to the overall story and gameplay. It’s good that the main character now has someone to talk to. The controls on the original Bioshock are driving me mad, but \u003cem\u003eInfinite\u003c/em\u003e has a secondary control style that is more like \u003cem\u003eCall of Duty\u003c/em\u003e, which I greatly prefer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"honorable-mention\"\u003eHonorable mention\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are games that I thought were very good, but didn’t quite make my top 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-legend-of-zelda-wind-waker-hdhttpswebarchiveorgweb20140111082846httpwwwzeldacomwindwaker-wii-u\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082846/http://www.zelda.com/windwaker/\"\u003eThe Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD\u003c/a\u003e (Wii U)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved playing the original \u003cem\u003eZelda: Wind Waker\u003c/em\u003e on my GameCube 12 years ago.

It has HD graphics, and some subtle improvements to the game. Sailing on the ocean is faster, so you can get from island-to-island faster. Also, the original had some interaction with the \u003cem\u003eGame Boy Advance\u003c/em\u003e which has now been replaced with the \u003cem\u003eWii U Gamepad\u003c/em\u003e serving the same purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I’ve enjoyed playing this updated version of the game, it didn’t make my top 5 for 2013 simply because the game is 12 years old.

        "plain":"For me, 2013 was a year where I picked back up in my gaming. Looking back, I spent way more time playing video games than I had in the last several years, and began following some gaming publications and podcasts. Top 5 These are my top 5 favorite games from 2013.\n5. Beyond: Two Souls (Playstation 3) Beyond: Two Souls surprised me with how good the visuals were. It had some of the best, realistic-looking humans I’ve ever seen in a game. The characters were modeled after, and voiced by, Ellen Page (Juno, Whip It, Super) and Willem Dafoe (Boondock Saints, Antichrist). It had a great story with lots of variety, so I never got bored.\nThe most interesting thing about Beyond: Two Souls was that it wasn’t really a game, so much as an interactive drama. Made by the same studio who did Heavy Rain, it was like watching a really long movie — except that you would control the main character from time to time to interact with elements in the environment.\nIf you’re interested in a really good game with lots of action, this might not be for you. But if you find yourself interested and drawn-in by the excellent story, it’s definitely worth checking out.\n4. Tomb Raider (Xbox 360) This was the very first Tomb Raider game I’d ever played, and I really enjoyed it. I’m a big fan of games with a good story, and this one had me on the edge of my seat a few times. Couple that with really solid gameplay, and this makes for an excellent game.\nLara Croft was voice-acted by Camilla Luddington, and the game offers a good arrangement of weapons and upgrades for the character. While the puzzles in the game aren’t quite like something you’d find in a Zelda game, there was still plenty of thinking and stealth involved as you moved to solve the mystery of the island.\n3. The Last of Us (Playstation 3) The Last of Us is set 20 years after a zombie outbreak. The main character, Joel, is not the same man now that he was when he lost his daughter on the first night of the outbreak. Now a smuggler, he is tasked with delivering a package to a group of freedom fighters outside of the police-state-like quarantine zone. His package is a 13-year old girl that may hold the secret to finding a cure for the infected.\nThis game pairs an excellent, excellent story, with really good gameplay and weapons. I died a lot while playing through this game on normal mode, but it was so good, and the ending had such a pay-off, that I immediately played it through a second time.\n2. Super Mario 3D World (Wii U) Nintendo is kinda like that friend you had growing up that you always had such a blast with. You don’t seem him much anymore because he’s wandered off and gotten into some really weird stuff. But every once in a while he calls you up, you go hang out, and you have a blast all over again. This is the story of Super Mario 3D World.\nThe best way that I can describe Super Mario 3D World is that it is really, really fun! All of the things you know and love about the Mario series — suits, power-ups, his friends — are all back again. But it isn’t just old-school Mario stuff; You also get to see many of the things from the Wii and DS-era Mario games (e.g., New Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 3D Land).\nEverybody knows that, with rare exception, the best games for any Nintendo console are the first-party games. After being (mostly) bored out of my mind with the few titles available for the Wii U (except for New Super Mario/Luigi Bros. U and Zelda: Wind Waker HD), I wasn’t sure that the game would be worth the cost. I was wrong.\nSuper Mario 3D World is one of the most fun games I’ve played in recent memory, and although I’m still working my way through it, everything about it has been an absolute delight.\n1. Bioshock Infinite (Xbox 360) Bioshock Infinite was my very first game in the Bioshock series (I’m currently playing through the first Bioshock now), and I must say — MIND BLOWN. From the prologue, to the twisted alternate universe, to the weapons and gameplay, to that mindf**k of an ending, Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game of the year.\nHaving gone back and played the original Bioshock after-the-fact, I can appreciate the improvements they’ve made to the overall story and gameplay. It’s good that the main character now has someone to talk to. The controls on the original Bioshock are driving me mad, but Infinite has a secondary control style that is more like Call of Duty, which I greatly prefer.\nHonorable mention These are games that I thought were very good, but didn’t quite make my top 5.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (Wii U) I loved playing the original Zelda: Wind Waker on my GameCube 12 years ago. I still have it. My son plays it regularly (although he really should have beaten the game by now, come to think of it).\nWind Waker HD is an update to the game, made exclusively for the Nintendo Wii U. It has HD graphics, and some subtle improvements to the game. Sailing on the ocean is faster, so you can get from island-to-island faster. Also, the original had some interaction with the Game Boy Advance which has now been replaced with the Wii U Gamepad serving the same purpose.\nWhile I’ve enjoyed playing this updated version of the game, it didn’t make my top 5 for 2013 simply because the game is 12 years old. It still holds up well, though.\nThe Wolf Among Us (OS X; Steam) The Wolf Among Us is a game made in the style of a 1950’s noir detective story, but darker and grittier. All of the fairytale animals from fables have been relocated to a modern-day city called “Fabletown”. They have the ability to look human in order to avoid suspicion, and The Big Bad “Bigby” Wolf has become the Sheriff.\nYou’re investigating the murder of a young girl, and you end up crossing paths with the Woodsman, Snow White, Ichabod Crane, Tweedle Dee \u0026amp; Dum, and others. This is not Walt Disney’s version of the characters either.\nOceanhorn (iOS) There are two games that I can think of for iOS that make me feel like I’m playing a Zelda game. The first is Lili. The second, released in 2013, is Oceanhorn.\nOceanhorn is an adventure game with a very Zelda-like feel, and is one of the best games I’ve played on iOS. The touchscreen controls are straightforward and intuitive, and it even supports the Game Controller Framework in iOS 7, in case you’ve been keeping an eye out for someone to make a good one (here’s hoping CES 2014 produces something good).\nGames that I haven’t played yet These are games that I’ve heard were amazing, but I haven’t yet had a chance to play.\n The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Grand Theft Auto V Stanley Parable Rayman Legends Gone Home  ",

Although I have several other gaming systems as well, my preference has always been for Nintendo.\n\nAnyways, I went down to the video store today, and rented a copy of [Mario Kart: Double Dash]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-652\" %}}) for my [GameCube]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/systemsgcn\" %}}). I stuck the disc in, and powered up the system. After an unusually long pause, the system went into setup mode, which is something is only does when the lid is open, or there is no game disc.\n\n“Maybe it’s just dust,” I thought to myself as I wiped off the disc on my shirt and blew across the laser lens to get rid of any dust that may have been there. I tried it again, and it still didn’t work. So, I grabbed my [Zelda: Wind Waker]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/gamemini?gameid=m-Game-0000-823\" %}}) disc and tried that one. Same problem. Getting frusterated, I tried my copy of [SSX Tricky]({{% wayback \"http://www.easportsbig.com/games/ssxtricky/home.jsp?ncc=1\" %}}). Still no luck. Well crap!\n\nAfter 15 minutes with no luck, I figured it was the system, so I went online to look at my warranty/repair options. I’ve had the system for just over a year-and-a-half, so the warranty is definitely expired. I looked up my options for paying for a repair, and the cost was $74.95! Oh my goodness! With all of the Day-After-Thanksgiving sales going on, I can get a brand-new system for $80. So that’s what I’m probably going to do. I hate to do it though, ’cause it’s paying $80 for *something I already have*.\n\nThen, I looked down at my NES (that I still have). I grabbed my Super Mario Bros 3 cartridge, blew into it, blew into my NES, put the game in and turned it on. Within a few seconds, I saw Mario and Luigi running around on the bottom of the screen, followed closely by three koopa turtles (with the third one slightly out of sync with the first two, as always). If my NES can last me 15 years, why can’t my GameCube last me two?\n\nI’ve got a Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis 2, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, GameBoy, GameBoy Advance, and a Nintendo GameCube, and it’s the GameCube that breaks. What the heck?!\n"},
