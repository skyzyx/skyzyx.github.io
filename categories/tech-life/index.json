        "plain":"With the impending shutdown of HipChat (February 2019), my team has been working hard on migrating everything over to Slack. Why not have some fun while we're at it?   Slackmoji Firstly, what is Slackmoji? Slackmoji (the word) refers to Slack + emoji — namely, the custom emoji you can add to your Slack account. It adds a bit of color and personality to the default Slack experience. Since I work in technology and the web, my set of Slackmoji tends to be Mac/Web/Browser-centric.\nMuch like the words emoji and fish, the plural of Slackmoji is also Slackmoji.\n                                          There are a few things I\u0026rsquo;ve learned as I\u0026rsquo;ve been creating my own slackmoji recently.\n  128 pixels is a pretty solid target for the size of the image — especially animated GIFs. Anything smaller and you end up with some nasty dithering around the edges of the animation.\n  Similar to emoji in iMessage (iOS), emoji-only lines will be at one size (32 points), while emoji+text lines are smaller (24 points).\n  When converting an Animoji recording into an animated GIF, expect you\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit each PNG frame to remove as much whitespace (and get as much character on-screen) as possible.\n  Before We Begin… While it\u0026rsquo;s possible that you can adapt these instructions to another platform, this tutorial is written assuming that:\n  You have a modern iOS device (like an iPhone or iPad), that is running at least iOS 11, and is signed into your iCloud account.\n  You have a modern Mac that is logged into the same iCloud account as your iOS device. In other words, you can receive your iMessages on your Mac.\n  You are not afraid of the Terminal, and you have Homebrew already installed.\n  Animated iMessage Stickers iMessage stickers use a format called Animated PNG (APNG) that was created by Mozilla back in 2008. Whereas PNG files have superior image fidelity over the older GIF format, the same is true for the animated versions of these formats. APNG is supported in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.\n Send yourself a sticker Start out by sending yourself an iMessage sticker from one of your favorite iMessage apps. In my case, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the Heart Container sticker from Zelda: Breath of the Wild. You can use whatever (animated) sticker you\u0026rsquo;d like.\n  Receive the sticker and save it Once the message has come through in Messages on your Mac, you can drag the image into a folder in Finder. I would recommend renaming it to something more memorable.\n  Neither Finder nor QuickLook is able to preview the animation in the APNG format, and simply shows the first frame. You can see the animation if you were to drag the image into Safari.\n Process the images into something usable In Terminal, install FFMPEG and Imagemagick using Homebrew.\nbrew install ffmpeg imagemagick How to make GIFs with FFMPEG and Imagemagick animated GIF layers showing through transparency were helpful in figuring this out.\n#! /usr/bin/env bash set -exo pipefail; find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \u0026#39;*.png\u0026#39; \\  | xargs -P $(nproc) -I {} bash -c \u0026#39; ff=$(basename -- \u0026#34;${1%.png}\u0026#34;); if [ ! -f \u0026#34;${ff}.gif\u0026#34; ]; then mkdir -p \u0026#34;/tmp/${ff}\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ ffmpeg \\ -i \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; \\ -filter_complex \u0026#34;[0:v] fps=12,scale=w=128:h=-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen=stats_mode=single [p];[b][p] paletteuse=new=1\u0026#34; \\ -y \u0026#34;/tmp/${ff}/%05d.png\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ convert -dispose 2 \u0026#34;/tmp/${ff}/*.png\u0026#34; \u0026#34;${ff}.gif\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ rm -Rf \u0026#34;/tmp/${ff}\u0026#34;; fi; \u0026#39; _ {} \\; Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down:\n  Find all files in the current directory that end with .png.\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \u0026#39;*.png\u0026#39;   Pipe those results into xargs.

Since I work in technology and the web, my set of Slackmoji tends to be Mac/Web/Browser-centric.\n\n{{\u003caside\u003e}}\n\u003cp\u003eMuch like the words \u003cem\u003eemoji\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003efish\u003c/em\u003e, the plural of \u003cem\u003eSlackmoji\u003c/em\u003e is also \u003cem\u003eSlackmoji\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c/aside\u003e}}\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-chrome.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-edge.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-firefox-developer-edition.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-firefox.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-internetexplorer.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-opera.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-safari.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"browser-safari-technology-preview.png\"\u003e}}\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-arrow-up.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-circular-arrow.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-double-arrow.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-red-arrow.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-pingpong.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-finger-number1.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-circle-321.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-crown.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-diamond.gif\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-trophy.gif\"\u003e}}\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-1password.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-alfredapp.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-casper.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-hipchat.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-keybase.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-msexcel.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-msword.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-sublime.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-things-app.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-virtualbox.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"icon-vmware-fusion.png\"\u003e}}\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv align=\"center\"\u003e\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"lang-swift.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"lang-typescript.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"lang-python.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"kubernetes.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"docker2.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"datadog.png\"\u003e}}\n  {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"zeldabotw-heart-container.gif\"\u003e}}\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\nThere are a few things I've learned as I've been creating my own slackmoji recently.\n\n1. 128 pixels is a pretty solid target for the size of the image — especially animated GIFs. Anything smaller and you end up with some nasty dithering around the edges of the animation.\n\n1. Similar to emoji in iMessage (iOS), emoji-only lines will be at one size (32 points), while emoji+text lines are smaller (24 points).\n\n1. When converting an [Animoji]({{\u003c wayback \"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208190\" \u003e}}) recording into an animated GIF, expect you'll need to edit each PNG frame to remove as much whitespace (and get as much character on-screen) as possible.\n\n## Before We Begin…\n\nWhile it's possible that you can adapt these instructions to another platform, this tutorial is written assuming that:\n\n* You have a modern iOS device (like an iPhone or iPad), that is running at least iOS 11, and is signed into your iCloud account.\n\n* You have a modern Mac that is logged into the same iCloud account as your iOS device. In other words, you can receive your iMessages on your Mac.\n\n* You are not afraid of the Terminal, and you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) already installed.\n\n## Animated iMessage Stickers\n\n{{\u003caside\u003e}}\n\u003cp\u003eiMessage stickers use a format called Animated PNG (APNG) that was created by Mozilla back in 2008. Whereas PNG files have superior image fidelity over the older GIF format, the same is true for the animated versions of these formats. APNG is supported in Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c/aside\u003e}}\n\n### Send yourself a sticker\n\nStart out by sending yourself an iMessage sticker from one of your favorite iMessage apps. In my case, I'm going to use the _Heart Container_ sticker from [Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zelda-breath-of-the-wild/id1321192590?mt=8). You can use whatever (animated) sticker you'd like.\n\n{{\u003c hls src=\"emoji-ios-send-sticker\" \u003e}}\n\n### Receive the sticker and save it\n\nOnce the message has come through in Messages on your Mac, you can drag the image into a folder in Finder. I would recommend renaming it to something more memorable.\n\n{{\u003c hls src=\"emoji-drag-to-mac\" \u003e}}\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n{{\u003caside\u003e}}\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Finder nor QuickLook is able to preview the animation in the APNG format, and simply shows the first frame. You can see the animation if you were to drag the image into Safari.\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c/aside\u003e}}\n\n### Process the images into something usable\n\nIn _Terminal_, install FFMPEG and Imagemagick using Homebrew.\n\n```bash\nbrew install ffmpeg imagemagick\n```\n\n[How to make GIFs with FFMPEG](https://engineering.giphy.com/how-to-make-gifs-with-ffmpeg/) and [Imagemagick animated GIF layers showing through transparency](https://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=2601) were helpful in figuring this out.\n\n```bash\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\nset -exo pipefail;\n\nfind . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.png' \\\n    | xargs -P $(nproc) -I {} bash -c '\n        ff=$(basename -- \"${1%.png}\");\n        if [ ! -f \"${ff}.gif\" ]; then\n            mkdir -p \"/tmp/${ff}\" \u0026\u0026 \\\n            ffmpeg \\\n                -i \"$1\" \\\n                -filter_complex \"[0:v] fps=12,scale=w=128:h=-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen=stats_mode=single [p];[b][p] paletteuse=new=1\" \\\n                -y \"/tmp/${ff}/%05d.png\" \u0026\u0026 \\\n            convert -dispose 2 \"/tmp/${ff}/*.png\" \"${ff}.gif\" \u0026\u0026 \\\n            rm -Rf \"/tmp/${ff}\";\n        fi;\n    ' _ {} \\;\n```\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. Find all files in the current directory that end with `.png`.\n\n    ```bash\n    find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.png'\n    ```\n\n1. Pipe those results into `xargs`. Parallelize the processes according to the number of cores you have (`nproc`). Each process will be a `bash` process.\n\n    ```bash\n    xargs -P $(nproc) -I {} bash -c ' ... ' _ {} \\;\n    ```\n\n1. Figure out the filename of the input, without the file extension. Save this value into the `ff` variable.\n\n    ```bash\n    ff=$(basename -- \"${1%.png}\");\n    ```\n\n1. Only process the files if we do not already have a same-named GIF file.\n\n    ```bash\n    if [ ! -f \"${ff}.gif\" ]; then\n      ...\n    fi;\n    ```\n\n1. We'll use the `/tmp` directory for our processing. Let's create a working directory with the name of the image.\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p \"/tmp/${ff}\"\n    ```\n\n1. Here's the complex part.\n\n    1. We call FFMPEG and specify our input file with `-i`.\n\n    1. We specify a set of complex rules using `-filter_complex`, but they key takeaways are that:\n\n        1. Set _frames per second_ to 12.\n\n        1. Set the _width_ to 128px, and the _height_ as auto.\n\n        1. We will pre-process the PNG first to generate a color palette, and the GIF processor will use this to help create better-colored images and cleaner transparency.\n\n    1. We set `-y` to overwrite any existing files.\n\n    1. We use some `bash` goodness to create filenames for each frame as a 5-digit value.\n\n    ```bash\n    ffmpeg -i \"$1\" \\\n        -filter_complex \"[0:v] fps=12,scale=w=128:h=-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen=stats_mode=single [p];[b][p] paletteuse=new=1\" \\\n        -y \"/tmp/${ff}/%05d.png\"\n    ```\n\n1. Use the `convert` command to read all of the PNG files and write a new GIF file.\n\n    ```bash\n    convert -dispose 2 \"/tmp/${ff}/*.png\" \"${ff}.gif\"\n    ```\n\n1. Let's clean up after ourselves by deleting our working directory.\n\n    ```bash\n    rm -Rf \"/tmp/${ff}\";\n    ```\n\n### Cleaning up\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2019/imageoptim@2x.png\" alt=\"ImageOptim\" figure=\"Using ImageOptim to squeeze unnecessary data out of your images.\"\u003e}}\n\nAt the end, you will have a new animated GIF image that you can upload into Slack. {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"zeldabotw-heart-container.gif\" inline=\"true\" \u003e}}\n\n## Converting Animoji or Memoji videos\n\n{{\u003caside\u003e}}\n\u003cp\u003eAnimoji and Memoji videos are sent as H.264 video and AAC audio, wrapped inside a QuickTime container. Audio will be removed as part of this process.\u003c/p\u003e\n{{\u003c/aside\u003e}}\n\n### Sending/receiving videos\n\nThis is done the same way as stickers. Follow the same process to get a file into Finder.\n\n### Process the images into something usable\n\nOverall, this is the exact same process, only we're going to stop mid-way and edit the frames.\n\n1. I've already explained what most of this does above, but this step is essentially extracting all of the frames in the video into a working folder under the `/tmp` directory.\n    \n    ```bash\n    find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.mov' \\\n        | xargs -P $(nproc) -I {} bash -c '\n            ff=$(basename -- \"${1%.mov}\");\n            if [ ! -f \"${ff}.gif\" ]; then\n                mkdir -p \"/tmp/${ff}\" \u0026\u0026 \\\n                ffmpeg \\\n                    -i \"$1\" \\\n                    -filter_complex \"[0:v] fps=12,scale=w=300:h=-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen=stats_mode=single [p];[b][p] paletteuse=new=1\" \\\n                    -y \"/tmp/${ff}/%05d.png\"\n            fi;\n        ' _ {} \\;\n    ```\n\n1. You'll want to use your favorite image editing tool (e.g., [Pixelmator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12), Photoshop). Crop as closely to the face as possible:\n\n    1. Keep every image an identical size.\n\n    1. Crop in an identical spot. Otherwise the frame location is going to be wrong.\n\n    1. You can use something like QuickLook to preview the frames. Feel free to delete any that don't make the animation better.\n\n    1. Since you need to squeeze your animation into a maximum of _128kb_, you have about 10–15 frames, _tops_.\n\n    {{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2019/animoji-editing@2x.jpg\" alt=\"Animating Animoji\"\u003e}}\n\n1. Once the frame editing is complete, merge each frame back into a single GIF image.\n    \n    ```bash\n    convert -dispose 2 \"/tmp/${ff}/*.png\" \"${ff}.gif\"\n    ```\n\n1. Cleanup once you're done.\n    \n    ```bash\n    rm -Rf \"/tmp/${ff}\";\n    ```\n\nAt the end, you will have a new animated GIF image that you can upload into Slack. {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"boom.gif\" inline=\"true\" \u003e}}\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith your new custom _Slackmoji_, you can bring your own style and personality to your Slack account. By borrowing some style from things that you enjoy, you can add a fun bit of flavor to your work conversations. {{\u003cslackmoji src=\"activity-diamond.gif\" inline=\"true\" \u003e}}\n"},

I’ve had a BlackBerry Pearl (8100) for the past 2 years, and the iPhone is a significantly better device for me. Here’s why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor starters, I’m an avid Mac user. I’ve spent many years on Mac and Windows systems, and I overwhelmingly prefer Mac. One of the biggest problems that I had as a Mac + BlackBerry user is that the syncing tools suck. PocketMac is a disaster, and the Mark/Space app (whatever it’s called) only works about one day per year. I ended up having to install the Google sync app on my BlackBerry and move my iCal calendars into Google Calendar, then re-import them with Google’s CalDAV support. A messy solution at best, and it still doesn’t solve the issue with my contacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eiPhone 3G, however, syncs with my Mac flawlessly (as expected). Because I have a MobileMe account, my contacts and calendars sync within minutes (faster if I force a push). On top of that, I have all of my email accounts routed through Gmail, so the mail client’s IMAP support makes configuring and managing my email simple. Beyond that, there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/skyzyx/2967792941/in/album-72157608322178739/\"\u003eall of the custom apps\u003c/a\u003e that are available now that the iPhone OS 2.0 software went live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apps I find myself using most (besides Contacts, Calendar, Phone, Safari, and iPod) are Brightkite, NetNewsWire, Things touch, Twitterrific, Apple Remote, Klick, TV Forecast, 1Password, Facebook, YPmobile, and nearly a dozen time-wasting games. I’ve even created a ringtone from the Dr. Horrible theme song. All-in-all, I’m happy with the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe on-screen keyboard responds and auto-corrects as quickly as I can type, which makes typing MUCH faster than it was on my BlackBerry.

Many of the ideas behind this venture were recently described by Chris Messina in a [much more eloquent manner]({{% wayback \"http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/10/31/opensocial-and-address-book-20-putting-people-into-the-protocol/\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Now, the big thing that’s changed (or is changing) is the emphasis on the individual and her role *across* the system. Look at [MyBlogLog]({{% wayback \"http://www.mybloglog.com/\" %}}). Look at [Automattic’s purchase of Gravatar]({{% wayback \"http://photomatt.net/2007/10/17/gravatar-sold/\" %}}). Look at the sharp rise in OpenID adoption over the past two years. The future is in non-siloed living man! The future is in portable, independent identities valid, like Visa, *everywhere that you want to be*. It’s not just about social network fatigue and getting fed up with filling out profiles at every social network you join and re-adding all your friends. Yeah, those things are annoying but more importantly, the fact that you *have to do it every time* just to get basic value from each system means that each has been designed to benefit itself, rather than the individuals coming and going. The whole damn thing needs to be inverted, and like recently rejoined ant segments dumped from many an ant farm, the [*fractured, divided, shattered into a billion fragments*]({{% wayback \"http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Smashing-Pumpkins/Spaced.html\" %}})-people of the web must rejoin themselves and become whole in the eyes of the services that, *what else?*, serve them!\n\nNormally I have no particular opinion of the term “Web 2.0”, although now as I think about it, it’s a bit of a misnomer. Web 2.0 began with XHTML and RSS. Later, Web 2.0 grew to include XML Web Services, Blogging, and Trackbacks (e.g., a cross-network, or an actual “web”).\n\nIn 2005, we saw the big AJAX push which was like fuel on the fire, and these days we have a buttload of social networks. The next step is a move to more “open” services, or at least more services that play well with others (see \"[OpenSocial]({{% wayback \"http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/\" %}})\"). This is the thing that I am most passionate about on the web. Connecting people together in people-centric, people-friendly ways. Adapting technology to fit people instead of the other way around.\n\nWith [SimplePie]({{% wayback \"http://simplepie.org\" %}}), we started of by taking something complex (RSS parsing), and making it simpler, easier, more flexible, and more robust. By enabling people to easily integrate other people’s content (or even their own), we’ve made it that much easier to integrate various parts of the web. At Foleeo, we’re wanting to take that several levels further. I like the quote by John Maeda from the book “The Laws of Simplicity”:\n\n\u003e Simplicity is subtracting the obvious and adding the meaningful.\n\nIf you’ve never read the book, I highly recommend it. It’s fairly short, and you could probably knock it out in a few hours, but it adds a tremendous perspective on how to simplify (good) while adding more value (better). And for me, the aforementioned quote is the driving force behind everything I build. I ask myself “how can we make this simpler, easier, yet more valuable for human beings?” (It suddenly occurred to me that I should start looking into books by [Jef Raskin]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin\" %}})). Here’s another favorite quote by Antoine de Saint-Exuper:\n\n\u003e Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\n\nBetween my work with SimplePie and Foleeo, I’m wanting to influence my little corner of the web to become something incredibly cool and/or useful that makes people marvel at how easy and intuitive it is. That takes a tremendous amount of work, but by focusing on people instead of technology, and by surrounding myself with some of the smartest, most talented people in the industry I plan to accomplish that goal.\n"},

You know that long line stitch in the sock that’s supposed to go straight over your toes? Yeah. My dad’s stitch was looping over his toes from the top to the bottom. I saw that and felt my brain short-circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was in Jr. High or High School, I started noticing that if you looked at my socks you could see where the big toe went. Apparently this was because I unconsciously wore the same socks on the same feet. A left-foot sock was always worn on the left foot, and the same was true for right-foot socks. I would even go so far as to flipping one sock inside-out if I could only find 2 left or right-foot socks. I still do this to this day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always, ALWAYS keep my wallet in my right pocket, and my keys, chapstick, and a pen in the left pocket. If I’m missing any of those items, I almost feel naked. Well, no. I take that back. But things do feel not-quite-right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen playing Monopoly, the Chance and Community Chest cards MUST stay within their assigned boxes on the board. If I notice them out of place, I have to fix them. Except for the times when somebody else moves my things, I haven’t lost my shoes, wallet, or car keys in over 10 years. Why? Because I only put them in one or two places when they’re not on my person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems funny to talk about, because it doesn’t seem like any of this is out of the ordinary… but for many people it is. My wife can’t keep track of her head, and it’s attached to her body. But even though I’ve been doing all of these things for my entire life (at least as long as I can remember, anyway), the thought of \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e being a little OCD never occurred to me until last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week, I discovered \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070331085737/http://openid.net/\"\u003eOpenID\u003c/a\u003e. OpenID is a cool system, where you can authenticate (sign-in) to an OpenID-enabled service, and that will activate your URL (your website address, among other things) as your OpenID “key” to other OpenID-enabled services. (I know that was probably a terrible way to explain it, but it’s really not all that relevant to the story.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e37signals launched a new service last week called \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070331085737/http://highrisehq.com\"\u003eHighrise\u003c/a\u003e, which is a way to manage your contacts, conversations you had with them, follow-up tasks, etc. Highrise also supports OpenID authentication. Once I got my OpenID set up, I logged into Highrise with it. I typed in “ryanparman.com”, and it logged me right in. I thought that was really cool, so I logged out, and again typed “ryanparman.com”. It logged me in again. Sweet. Log out, type “ryanparman.com” again. Log back in. I’m not really sure how long this went on for, but I began looking for other services that supported OpenID, like Zooomr, and Live Journal, and there’s a Mediawiki extension that supports it, and there are at least a couple dozen sites and/or services that support it already. I just kept logging in, logging out, logging in, logging out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while I looked at the clock, and realized I’d been logging in and out of services for about two hours. Two hours of my life — wasted — because I thought that OpenID authentication was really cool. No… it’s, like, 5 minutes cool. Maybe 10. Not 120 minutes cool. Not two hours cool. And here I sit, talking about something I never noticed about myself until last week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes sense though, and it certainly explains a lot of my behavior over the last 27 years. It explains why I have a sock “thing”. It explains why things need to be alphabetized. It explains why when I’m drinking a Pepsi from a can, I never leave any Pepsi in the lip of the can after each drink. It explains why I’m the one who’s responsible for how my furniture is arranged and how the kitchen is organized — not my wife. It explains why I became a web developer… and before that I was a musician… and before that I was a kid who was really good at math.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThing is, I’m not sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, it certainly serves me well that I never lose my shoes or my keys. But I know it drives other people crazy. Should I even care? My impulsive side wants to arbitrarily change something about the way I do things. Sometimes that works out for me, and sometimes it drives me crazy.

You now have your music playing on your home stereo and a visual layout of the track info and album art all together. (Almost-)instant Home Media Center!\n\n## Alternate Method\n\nAn alternative method that I’ve tried out worked well since I have a PC and TiVo’d TV in my bedroom, and I have some 5.1 Surround speakers connected to my Windows XP machine. I launched iTunes, iSee iTunes, and [Nicecast]({{% wayback \"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/nicecast/\" %}}) on my Powerbook. I broadcast a signal (via Nicecast) to iTunes on my PC, and had the audio play through my fancy speakers. Meanwhile, I used iSee iTunes to display the cool music info on my TV screen. Not quite as fancy, but still works well.\n"},

I opened up my PowerBook manual, and read that I’d need a Philips screwdriver, size double-zero. Essentially, the smallest screwdriver ever created in the history of the world.

Home Depot couldn’t figure out what I was talking about, but Orchard Supply Hardware (OSH) did. Luckily they were right around the corner from me, so I took the minute-and-a-half trek over there to see what they had. After about 20 minutes of digging, I found a Philips screwdriver, size double-zero. I bought it, took it home, and sat down again with my laptop. Still too big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called up the Apple Store at Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara, CA. They said that they could install the memory for a $30 fee, and that they were open until 9:30pm. Reluctantly, I got into my car and drove the 25+ minutes to the mall, parked, and walked into the Apple Store which was clear across the mall from where I’d parked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking up to the “Genius Bar”, I saw one person in line ahead of me, so I sat down in a chair and waited.

I walked over to a computer by the wall, double-clicked the Genius Bar icon, and filled out the webpage form. The webpage told me that the next available appointment was at 8:45pm. This was at 8:31pm. I walked back over to the Genius Bar, and the Genius told me it would be a few minutes. Nobody was in line, but apparently since my “appointment” was at 8:45, then by golly I was going to wait until 8:45. At 8:45, the Genius asked what he could do for me. I told him that the information in the PowerBook manual was incorrect. The double-zero screwdriver was too small. And although I’m perfectly capable of installing my own RAM chip, I can’t find the appropriate tools anywhere, so I’m stuck coughing up $30 to have them do it. He looked at my PowerBook, then at my Crucial.com RAM box, then at me. “I’m sorry sir, but we can’t install that RAM.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?!” I asked, clearly fuming from irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;We can only install memory that you buy here, and we can’t allow anyone to use our tools.

I went through the process of explaining how small the mythical screwdriver is that I need, and was wondering of they either sold them or would let me borrow one for five minutes. Nope, and nope. However, one of the technicians just \u003cem\u003ehappened\u003c/em\u003e to walk by and over hear me talking to the clerk at the counter. “Will this help?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down with it, and in 5 minutes I was looking at the “About this Mac” dialog that listed 1 GB DDR SDRAM. “Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou!” I said.

As I walked out, and older woman told me that she thought it was very nice of me to have come back to tell them what I did about the Lens Crafters store.

Mac OS’s “Millions” of colors is equal to 16,777,216 colors, which is equal to Windows’ 24-bit color, because in binary, 111111111111111111111111 is equal to 16,777,216 in decimal. Duh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next few hours, my brain was into binary. I licked the cheese powder off my fingers, turned off the TV, put some pants on, and sat down at my computer. A few months ago, I wrote a \u003ca href=\"/scripts/convert.php\"\u003eNumber Conversion Object\u003c/a\u003e that is able to convert between Decimal (base 10) and Binary (base 2). I decided to put it to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, my mind wandered into video games. Nintendo was 8-bit (256 colors), Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis were 16-bit (65,536 colors), Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn were 32-bit (4,294,967,296 colors). JavaScript’s Math object gets a little flaky if the numbers get too big. It’ll hold the places with zeroes. I went ahead with the next calculations. Atari Jaguar and Nintendo 64 were 64-bit (18,446,744,073,709,552,000 colors). I don’t even know how many “-illions” that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent video game systems are 128-bit. That translates to 3.402823669209385 × 10³⁸. That’s a freakin’ big number. Then I began thinking about encryption. Most browsers have 128-bit encryption.

I recalled a conversation I had with my best frind about 8 years ago about the Mac’s 256, Thousands, and Millions of colors versus Windows 8, 16, and 24-bit color. He was saying that he was excited because he’d pushed his Windows 95 computer to display 16.7 million colors.\nIt was Saturday when the obvious struck me. Mac OS’s “Millions” of colors is equal to 16,777,216 colors, which is equal to Windows’ 24-bit color, because in binary, 111111111111111111111111 is equal to 16,777,216 in decimal. Duh!\nFor the next few hours, my brain was into binary. I licked the cheese powder off my fingers, turned off the TV, put some pants on, and sat down at my computer.

That translates to 3.402823669209385 × 10³⁸. That’s a freakin’ big number. Then I began thinking about encryption. Most browsers have 128-bit encryption.

[Zeldman]({{% wayback \"http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0803a.shtml#spelling\" %}}) also comments on this point, and finds an opportunity to mention his [little orange book]({{% wayback \"http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/\" %}}).\n\nMezzoblue’s [“A Second Voice”]({{% wayback \"http://www.mezzoblue.com/secondvoice/\" %}}) has a terrific [article about standards-evangelism]({{% wayback \"http://www.mezzoblue.com/cgi-bin/mt/mezzo/archives/000238.asp\" %}}) There was also a good comment about Kottke’s article over at [SimpleBits]({{% wayback \"http://www.simplebits.com/archives/2003/08/27/this_validates.html\" %}}). [Dan Cederholm]({{% wayback \"http://www.simplebits.com\" %}}) has presented the first [SimpleQuiz]({{% wayback \"http://www.simplebits.com/archives/2003/08/27/simplequiz_part_i_headings.html\" %}})!
