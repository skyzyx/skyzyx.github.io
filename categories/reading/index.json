With how many sites I follow, I should really rename it to “Blogs I Scan”, but I still read more than I scan. On top of that, some aren’t even blogs. They’re news sites. Oh well. Most of them are read in heavy rotation by many people already, but I’m fairly picky with what I bother to read. Anyways, here they are (in alphabetical order). All of them have been added within the last 2–3 weeks.\n\n* [Afterdawn]({{% wayback \"http://www.afterdawn.com/\" %}})\n* [Ars Technica]({{% wayback \"http://www.arstechnica.com/\" %}})\n* [Brainstorms and Raves]({{% wayback \"http://www.brainstormsandraves.com/\" %}})\n* [Branchleft]({{% wayback \"http://www.branchleft.co.uk/\" %}})\n* [Clagnut]({{% wayback \"http://www.clagnut.com/\" %}})\n* [Design By Fire]({{% wayback \"http://www.designbyfire.com/\" %}})\n* [Design Meme]({{% wayback \"http://www.designmeme.com/\" %}})\n* [Dooce]({{% wayback \"http://www.dooce.com/\" %}})\n* [IBeBloggin’]({{% wayback \"http://blog.vinniegarcia.com/\" %}})\n* [Nick Bradbury]({{% wayback \"http://nick.typepad.com/blog/\" %}})\n* [OS News]({{% wayback \"http://www.osnews.com/\" %}})\n* [Plasticbag.org]({{% wayback \"http://www.plasticbag.org/\" %}})\n* [The Register]({{% wayback \"http://www.theregister.co.uk/\" %}})\n* [Robot Johnny]({{% wayback \"http://www.robotjohnny.com/\" %}})\n* [Sken.be]({{% wayback \"http://www.sken.be/\" %}})\n* [Signal vs Noise]({{% wayback \"http://www.37signals.com/svn/\" %}})\n* [Slorp!]({{% wayback \"http://www.splorp.com/\" %}})\n* [Something Normal]({{% wayback \"http://www.somethingnormal.com/\" %}})\n* [Surfin’ Safari]({{% wayback \"http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/\" %}})\n* [Textbased]({{% wayback \"http://www.textbased.com/\" %}})\n* [Think Secret]({{% wayback \"http://www.thinksecret.com/\" %}})\n* [Twenty4.org]({{% wayback \"http://www.twenty4.org/\" %}})\n* [Wired News]({{% wayback \"http://www.wired.com/\" %}})\n\nI’ve also categorized them all into various sections. Each section has an OPML feed so that you can import any or all of these feeds straight into your RSS/Atom Reader.\n\nThe “Recent Posts” part of each blog listing displays the 3 most recent posts to each website. There is also a fourth option, “Read More »”, that allows you to read the RSS feed through the normal Skyzyx.com interface, via my [RSS/Atom Reader](/rss/). Simple, cool, easy.\n\nAlso, I know that I just gave it away, but I’ve added [Really Stupid Atom Support]({{% wayback \"http://www.papascott.de/2004/01/03/2785.php\" %}}) to my installation of the [Magpie RSS Parser]({{% wayback \"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/\" %}}). It now supports Atom 0.3 feeds, but I haven’t tested earlier Atom feeds. If anyone thinks Atom 0.2 or 0.1 support is worthwhile, [contact me](/contact/) with a feed URL.\n\nI’ve been asked about parsing RSS feeds for people who don’t have PHP. Since I don’t know Perl, and some people couldn’t use it anyways, I’ve begun writing an RSS/Atom parser in JavaScript. No ETA yet, but it’s on the way.\n"},
