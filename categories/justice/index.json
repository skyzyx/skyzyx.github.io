Nobody — criminal or otherwise — should be deprived of life.\n\n\u003e **Amendment VI**\n\u003e\n\u003e **In all criminal prosecutions**, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\n\nIt is **not** the job nor responsibility of law enforcement to perform the duties of judge, jury, and executioner.\n\n\u003e **Amendment VIII**\n\u003e\n\u003e Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, **nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted**.\n\nLike death.\n\n## Society requires balance\n\nIn exchange for _granting_ law enforcement officers, judges, elected officials, and other people an increased level of authority in our society, _we the people_ have rights.\n\nLaw enforcement officers, judges, and elected officials bear a **greater responsibility** than civilians do.
