It's a heart problem, not a gun problem. Jeremiah 17:9\" figure=\"“TRUTH!!!”, my friend exclaimed.\" width=\"497\"\u003e}}\n\nAs a rational person who values evidence and critical thinking, this photo misses the point by grossly oversimplifying a very complex issue. And while it maybe be _technically_ true, that’s only in the most ideal sociological conditions.\n\nThe real world is far more complex.\n\n(Instead of being flippant and dismissive toward people you disagree with, challenge the things that you think you know. See if those ideas hold-up to scrutiny when the hard questions are asked. I did, and I realized that there were some really good, valid points being made by both sides of the gun ownership issue. Take the time to listen to what other people think, and why they think it, and you might see a perspective you hadn’t seen before.)\n\n## It’s far too easy…\n\nIt's not about the gun, per sé, but it is definitely about the ability to commit mass-murder with a gun. I've never seen or heard of anybody committing mass-murder with a rock.\n\nWe have invented procedures and invested in research and development to make cars safer, airplanes safer, construction equipment safer, kitchen appliances safer, etc. Why isn't the weapons industry investing into better procedures and security for weapons?\n\nNeither a \"heart\" nor a rock are able to [kill 50 people in a nightclub within minutes]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article83297102.html\" \u003e}}). A rock _could_ be used to [kill a 22 year old singer who is signing autographs after a concert]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/us/christina-grimmie-singer-on-the-voice-dies-in-shooting-at-concert.html\" \u003e}}). However, if by investing more effort into background checks and psychological evaluations, or by inventing biometrics safety techniques or other methods which prevent accidental gun deaths, how many lives could be saved?\n\n## Two sides of the same coin.\n\nI strongly support _responsible_ gun ownership **AND** strong gun control laws. Those are not opposing ideas, but rather complementary ones. I personally believe there is value in more people being armed — primarily people performing security roles at schools, malls and airports. Looking at someone and expecting that they are packing heat will keep your actions in check.\n\nBut I also believe that asking people to undergo a psychological evaluation is not an unreasonable request. Neither is closing the _gun show_ loophole, or asking people to certify before they can legally own a gun (and re-certify every few years, like a driver's license), or requiring a class which educates you on responsible, legal gun ownership versus hand-me-down stories of what can do (or get away with) with a gun.\n\n(For example, it is a federal crime to shoot down an operational aircraft — including a drone — that is flying in the airspace above your property. You may own the land, but you do not own the air above it.)\n\nIt is a 100% perfect system? Absolutely not. A determined person will **always** find a way to do whatever they’re going to do. But just because the idea or implementation is not 100% perfect doesn't mean that _we shouldn't bother doing anything at all_.\n\n## Guns don't kill people, but we can do _better_.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/gun-murders.jpg\" alt=\"The United States has 3–4× the number of gun-related murders per capita than any other modern, civilized nation. This does not include accidental gun-related deaths.\" figure=\"The United States has 3–4× the number of gun-related murders per capita than any other modern, civilized nation. This does not include accidental gun-related deaths.\"\u003e}}\n\nGuns don't kill people. _People kill people_. But that doesn’t absolve our society of responsibility for the actions that we allow our people to take.\n\nYes, it is true that people kill people. But a gun in the hands of a dangerous person is capable of taking a substantially higher number of lives at once than nearly any other weapon humankind has ever devised[^1]. We do not show enough respect for this dangerous capability as we should as a society.\n\n[^1]: Bombs are capable of killing even _more_ people than guns. But guns are also much easier to access legally.\n\nWhat if we could reduce gun-related deaths by 20%… 30%… 40%? Would that be worth it? Are the lives of those people are worth it? Are the lives of the kids at Sandy Hook Elementary worth it? Are the lives of the reporter and cameraman who were gunned-down on-air worth it? Are the lives of the kids who get a hold of their parents’ gun and accidentally kill themselves, their parent, or their siblings worth it?\n\nGuns are far too easy to purchase through legal channels because of well-known loopholes in the system. By closing the legal loopholes, law enforcement can spend more time focusing on covering illegal gun sales.\n\n## Justifying an outrageous failure\n\nFrance, Germany, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Australia, Spain, and even the Czech Republic are ahead of us on this issue. For a country which claims to be _the best country in the entire world_, how can we continue to justify such an outrageous failure of our society?\n\nGun control does **not** mean _taking away your guns_. It doesn’t mean a _disarmament_ of you and your family (unless your family is crazy, of course). It refers to the _enforcement of the responsibility_ of owning a gun. You’re responsible, right?\n\nThe founding fathers granted us the right to form and maintain a militia… using **muskets**. They did not know that one day the weapons industry would rake-in _billions of dollars per year_. They did not know that our society would shift from being primarily rural to being primarily urban/industrial. It does not mean that you are **guaranteed** the right to own _assault weapons_.\n\n## How much longer?\n\nHow long are we going to stand by and do nothing (except pray) while angry/crazy people shoot-up large groups of people? How long are we going to update our Facebook profile photos with the French flag, or hear about **yet another** mass-shooting (San Bernadino, Orlando, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, etc.), and choose to do **absolutely nothing at all** about lifting a finger to make things better?\n\nBecause guns. Or politics. Or religion that has been tainted by politics. They have propagandized the heck out of the second amendment, and the gun industry is — ahem — making a “killing” in revenue.\n\nI have concerns about unfettered gun ownership. I’m sure that you also have your own concerns about the gun ownership issue. But we certainly recognize that a problem exists, right? That mass-shooting after mass-shooting is not _normal_, right? We don’t live in central Africa, or Colombia, or Mexico City, right?\n\nWe need to work together to come up with something better than what we have today.

THAT is the definition of “gun control” — the rules by which people can buy, sell, and own guns (which, may I remind you, are _some_ of the most dangerous weapons that humankind has ever invented).\n\nYou wouldn’t hand a toddler a hunting knife, would you?\n\n## Update ({{\u003cdate \"2018-08-05\"\u003e}})\n\nMaybe I was wrong.

That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd follows that up with an important premise:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lastly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government.

The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-a-better-america\"\u003eMaking A Better America\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ePhoto by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen \u003cem\u003edramatically\u003c/em\u003e since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works.

        "plain":"In response to “I moved to the US 7 years ago from Finland — here's what Americans don't understand about Nordic countries”, and why I support Bernie Sanders. This was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s what Americans don\u0026rsquo;t understand about Nordic countries Anu Partanen, writing for The Atlantic:\n Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Bernie Sanders ’ Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they\u0026rsquo;d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\nA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\nThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\n And follows that up with an important premise:\n But this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for me.\n And lastly,\n Americans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government. In fact, as a proud Finn, I often like to remind my American friends that my countrymen in Finland fought two brutal wars against the Soviet Union to preserve Finland\u0026rsquo;s freedom and independence against socialism. No one wants to live in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support individual liberty, entrepreneurship, and open markets.\nBut the truth is that free-market capitalism and universal social policies go well together — this isn\u0026rsquo;t about big government, it\u0026rsquo;s about smart government.\n This is a very good piece, and I hope you can take a few minutes to read it all. In the U.S., and especially among the Boomer generation, they hear \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and tend to equate it with Russian communism (which was actually never communism, but rather a dictator-style totalitarian socialism).\nToo Much Capitalism Is Bad For You  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/5065175199/in/album-72157652056682098/\n For me, I see the pros and cons of such a capitalistic-driven society. The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\nSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\nMaking A Better America  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\n I want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen dramatically since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\nWhat I’m currently hearing from Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , and Rand Paul is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again and including all Americans in that plan.\nUnfair?

America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026 fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\n\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don't think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government's role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026 fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\n\n## Making A Better America\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \"bitch\" or a \"whore\" just because she doesn't want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\n\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen *dramatically* since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don't know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nWhat I’m currently hearing from {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}}, {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}}, and {{\u003c person name=\"Rand Paul\" \u003e}} is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again **and** including all Americans in that plan.\n\n## Unfair?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/ignoring-the-obvious.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/22122675480/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nYes, a 60 year old couple with no kids paying more money in taxes so that some other couple can have their kids in better daycare sounds unfair at first. But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don't like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they're not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn't want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\n\nMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing. By raising-up the foundation for everyone, everybody benefits, albeit indirectly.\n\n## Support the Radical Center\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/losing-our-competitive-edge.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nLastly, I think our current 2-party system is the most toxic aspect of American politics. What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you **must** vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate. The Republican party has already assumed that Clinton will win the nomination on the Democratic side, but the race between herself and Sanders is extremely close. Conversely, the fact that loose cannons like {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}} and {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}} have made it as far as they have over more sane and level-headed candidates like {{\u003c person name=\"Rand Paul\" \u003e}} and {{\u003c person name=\"Marco Rubio\" \u003e}} is saddening.\n\nThe only way to break free of the 2-party system is to stop reinforcing this 2-party mentality. IMO, it’s toxic to the American people that the RNC and the DNC are private corporations who pay for broadcast airtime, and can change the rules to determine who can/cannot be part of the debates. This leads to _Tweedism_, and further separates the voters from the nomination process (in addition to _super-delegates_ and the _electoral college_).\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"tweedism\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/pFZEV7TeZBg\"\n       sourceTitle=\"Lessig at MIT: \\\"Tweedism\\\"\"\n\u003e}}\n\nI would also love to see the entire population of the United States abstain from the next election until we could vote on meaningful campaign finance reform, but that will never happen.\n\n## Reform\n\nUltimately, however, none of the promises made by presidential candidates will come to pass without [substantial campaign finance reform]({{\u003c search \"campaign finance reform 2017\" \u003e}}). Congress decides on the budget, and it is the President’s job to spend that budget. With so many congresspeople in the pockets of large corporations instead of working in the best interests of the citizens they represent, there is little that will be accomplished until we achieve meaningful reform. With {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}} taking money from the Oil \u0026 Coal industries, with {{\u003c person name=\"Hillary Clinton\" \u003e}} taking money from Wall Street, and with {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}} taking money from the KKK, we’re all in big trouble.\n\n[Citizen-funded elections]({{\u003c wayback \"http://lessig2016.us/the-plan/\" \u003e}}) is the only way to achieve this.\n\n## P.S.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/check-their-facts.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nI would rather see the debates on both sides handled like _The Newsroom_, where any claims made by candidates are immediately fact-checked and untrue answers are discarded.\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"newsroom-mock-debate\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/AF-BZsrtoPs\"\n       sourceTitle=\"HBO: The Newsroom EP9 \\\"Mock Debate\\\"¹\"\n\u003e}}\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"footnotes\"\u003e\n  \u003chr\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"f6 gray\"\u003eFeatured image by \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/diversey/15325678721/in/album-72157647164491333/\"\u003eTony Webster\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"f6 gray\"\u003e¹ Fair use, copyright exemption claim: Low-quality version of the clip used for the purpose of educating readers about the importance of fact-checking the rhetoric that is commonplace in the American political system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n"},

We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable.

You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the  education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed.

        "plain":"As a political moderate who values sanity and evidence over emotional rage in politics, I really tried to keep an open mind about the various candidates from across the political spectrum. I wanted to listen to what they had to say, watch how respectfully they treated the other candidates — across party lines — and dissect and challenge their empty rhetoric.\nThis was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n  https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157624426458536/\n Things I believe in   We live in a digital world, that will continue to become more digital as time passes. We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see Net Neutrality).\n  God made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\n  As an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\n  I strongly support \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\n  I believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\n  My daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth. Why is she only worth 77% of a man in the workplace? I’ve seen/heard how women are treated in the dating scene and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\n  Why is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the Real Housewives of Wherever with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but it’s just a nipple.\n  The war on drugs was a failure, so let\u0026rsquo;s move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t change anybody but yourself\u0026rdquo; is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\n  We over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\n  Sex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026amp; 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u0026lt;5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\n  I am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\n  I support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting hearing and sight recovery, as well as ALS (a.k.a., Lou Gehrig’s Disease).\n  Changing jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\n  I absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote against, instead of telling why they themselves are worth voting for. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\n  I believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics. Anything we can do to break-apart the two-party system would be a fantastic improvement over what we have today.\n  The Tea Party is the American Taliban.\n   https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\n My background I was raised in a very conservative, Christian, Republican household.

We live in a digital world, that will continue to become more digital as time passes. We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see [Net Neutrality]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality\" \u003e}})).\n\n1. God made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\n\n1. As an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\n\n1. I strongly support \"freedom\" in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\n\n1. I believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\n\n1. My daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth. Why is she only worth 77% of a man in the workplace? I’ve seen/heard how [women are treated in the dating scene](https://instagram.com/byefelipe/) and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\n\n1. Why is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the _Real Housewives of Wherever_ with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but _it’s just a nipple_.\n\n1. The war on drugs was a failure, so let's move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \"you can't change anybody but yourself\" is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\n\n1. We over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\n\n1. Sex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u003c5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\n\n1. I am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the  education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\n\n1. I support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting [hearing and sight recovery]({{\u003c wayback \"http://stemcells.nih.gov/research/scilit/highlights/pages/default.aspx\" \u003e}}), as well as ALS (a.k.a., [Lou Gehrig’s Disease]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.webmd.com/brain/features/als-stem-cell-patient-trial\" \u003e}})). \n\n1. Changing jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\n\n1. I absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote _against_, instead of telling why they themselves are worth _voting for_. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\n\n1. I believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics. Anything we can do to break-apart the two-party system would be a fantastic improvement over what we have today.\n\n1. [The Tea Party is the American Taliban.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGAvwSp86hY)\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/check-their-facts.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n\n## My background\n\nI was raised in a very conservative, Christian, Republican household. I was taught that you had to vote Republican because otherwise the evil Democrats will win. And although they never actually said it, I was definitely taught that _Jesus votes Republican_. It wasn’t until my mid-20’s that I started seriously reviewing the issues, asking hard questions about them, and seeing where things still stood up vs. where they fell down. In the end, I realized that most things I’d been taught, politically, didn’t stand-up to scrutiny very well. I also wasn’t a strong supporter of most of what the Democratic party stood for either, so I find myself as an Independent — neither major party represents me.\n\nWith the direction that the Republican party has taken over the last 20 years, I find that they represent me less and less with each passing year. My own observations have shown me: More discrimination. More lying and misdirection instead of facts. More hatred towards people who aren’t WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants). More fear, uncertainty and doubt. More pro-theocratic thinking. Anti-women efforts. Pro-business/anti-citizen efforts. Support of the Constitution, but against the Government, because they don’t know how the Constitution works. Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n\n## Rankings and Standings\n\nFor me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric. There are zero people whom I agree with 100%. Some issues matter more to me than others, and based on the ones that matter, this is where I stand with the current candidates.\n\n1. **Definitely Yes:** [Larry Lessig]({{\u003c wayback \"https://lessig2016.us/\" \u003e}}), [Bernie Sanders]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Bernie_Sanders.htm\" \u003e}}) — Both are pro-citizen, are willing to listen to others, campaign finance reform, do NOT take an _us-against-them_ stance, and support positive change for this country. They have not accepted any money from Super PACs, except for Larry Lessig who founded the [MayDay Super PAC]({{\u003c wayback \"https://mayday.us\" \u003e}}) — “the Super PAC to end all Super PACs.” I disagree with Bernie Sanders’ stance on abortion, but fully support his stance on reproductive health, contraception, and sexual education.\n\n1. **Wouldn’t be Angry:** [Hillary Clinton]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Hillary_Clinton.htm\" \u003e}}) — She’s pro-women and pro-minorities, which could help to lay the groundwork for when my daughter comes of age. I have not seen her do any mud-slinging thus far, except to suggest that she disagrees with much of what was discussed during the Republican debates. At the same time, she’s done some really shady things around sending top-secret emails though her personal email server (!!), and she supports treating [Edward Snowden](/2013/11/14/fisa-the-nsa-prism-and-edward-snowden/) like a domestic terrorist. She’s also raised most of her money from Super PACs.\n\n1. **Would be irritated:** [Rand Paul]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Rand_Paul.htm\" \u003e}}) — He’s been really hit-or-miss so far. He started his campaign by [slinging mud and rhetoric against Hillary Clinton]({{\u003c wayback \"https://randpaul.com/liberty-not-hillary\" \u003e}}) instead of telling us why we should vote for him. He supports simplifying the tax code (yay!) but is against Net Neutrality (boo!). He is also a candidate that has enjoyed using the rhetorical call-to-action “[we need to take America back]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ftVjxNrvw\" \u003e}})” without ever explaining what on earth that even means. Back to the Salem Witch Trials? Back to slavery and segregation? Back to when women couldn’t vote? Back to the recession, multiple wars, and the [Credit Crisis]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0zEXdDO5JU\" \u003e}}) from last decade?\n\n1. **OMGWTFBBQ:** [Ted Cruz]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Ted_Cruz.htm\" \u003e}}), [Jeb Bush]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm\" \u003e}}), [Mike Huckabee]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Huckabee.htm\" \u003e}}), [Carly Fiorina]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Carly_Fiorina.htm\" \u003e}}) — [Ted Cruz wants to kill the Ayatollah]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/25/ted-cruz-threatens-to-kill-the-ayatollah.html\" \u003e}}) and thinks that [Net Neutrality is ObamaCare for the Internet]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/ted-cruz-net-neutrality_n_6133584.html\" \u003e}}). Mike Huckabee believes that [it’s perfectly OK for a government employee to violate the Constitution]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-jail-huckabee_55ef258be4b093be51bc5dcc\" \u003e}}) because it’s against [Kim Davis’ faith to support gay marriage]({{\u003c wayback \"http://m.snopes.com/kim-davis-married-four-times/\" \u003e}}). Of course, so is sex outside of marriage and divorcing for reasons other than infidelity or abandonment[¹]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/deu.24.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[²]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/mat.5.31-33.kjv\" \u003e}})[³]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/rom.7.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[⁴]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/1co.7\" \u003e}}), but who’s counting? The others, I simply disagree with on the majority of issues — at least in cases where they are clear where they stand.\n\n1. **The worst possible thing for America:** [Donald Trump]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\" \u003e}}) — Misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, sexist, selfish, pro-business at the cost of individual citizens, enthusiastically leverages tax/legal loopholes for personal gain, and is a supporter of continued “cronyism” in government. Although, I agree with him that we should stop buying oil from foreign nations, and should instead rely on ourselves.\n\nI am most-aligned with [Elizabeth Warren]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm\" \u003e}}), although she isn’t running — this time around, anyway.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/vote-moderate.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n"},

Patty Murray.\n\n## Internet Issues: SOPA/PIPA\n\n\u003e I am a Washington State voter, and I want to urge you to denounce, reject and vote against the SOPA \u0026 PIPA bills currently working their way through Congress.\n\u003e\n\u003e Information: \u003chttp://americancensorship.org\u003e\n\u003e\n\u003e The MPAA/RIAA lobbyists (who naturally have an anti-technology, pro-censorship bias) have managed to get our “representatives” to push these bills into Congress in an attempt to allow private corporations to censor the Internet.\n\u003e\n\u003e The Internet is a public utility. What if AT\u0026T or Verizon could decide who you were allowed to call? Or who was allowed to have a telephone number at all? What if FedEx or UPS were allowed to decide whether or not you had an address to deliver packages to?\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s anti-American, it’s unconstitutional, and it’s just plain wrong.\n\u003e\n\u003e When the opportunity to vote on these bills comes your way, please vote with the people you represent — not with the lobbyists.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you.\n\u003e\n\u003e P.S. I find it interesting that there is no “Internet Issues” selection on your contact form. “Internet” is different from “Science and Technology”. It’s 2012. The Internet is a critical component of how people communicate and get work done.\n\u003e\n\u003e I would encourage you to pay attention to pro-Internet voters, because there is an entire generation of millennials who will very soon make up the majority of American voters.\n\nI encourage you all to contact your representatives in government and let them know about your disapproval of these laws (in America), or similar laws in other countries.\n\n## Update: Response from Sen. Maria Cantwell\n\n\u003e Dear Mr. Parman,\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you for contacting me about the internet streaming of copyrighted material. I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.\n\nThis isn’t what I contacted you about, and both SOPA/PIPA go *way* beyond the simple law enforcement of streaming copyrighted material.\n\n\u003e On May 12, 2011, Senator Leahy (D-VT) introduced S. 968, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act. While I am supportive of the goals of the bill, I am deeply concerned that the definitions and the means by which the legislation seeks to accomplish these goals will have unintended consequences and hurt innovation, job creation, and threaten online speech and security. On November 17, 2011, I signed a letter along with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) objecting to the bill as it is currently written.\n\nYou are correct. This is really, really bad.\n\n\u003e On December 17, 2011, Senator Wyden introduced the “Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade” (OPEN) Act (S. 2029), of which I am an original co-sponsor.\n\n/me raises eyebrow…\n\n\u003e The bill has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee, where it is currently awaiting further review. The OPEN Act is a more effective approach to stopping foreign web sites that are found to be primarily and willfully used to infringe intellectual property rights. The OPEN Act builds on the existing legal framework used by the International Trade Commission for addressing unfair acts in the importation of articles into the United States, or in their sale for importation, or sale within the United States after importation.\n\nThe United States government is working beyond the realm of its jurisdiction here. It might be currently legal, but this is still a bad thing. Who determines what “primarily and willfully used to infringe intellectual property rights” even means? How is this really any better?\n\nAnd you’re a co-sponsor of this legislation?\n\n\u003e Our trade laws have yet to catch up to deal with the global digital economy.\n\nIncredibly, incredibly true. As a matter of fact, copyright law itself can be placed in this very same bucket.\n\n\u003e The OPEN Act recognizes that the Internet has created new opportunities for foreign products to reach the U.S. market and that there is little difference between downloading a pirated movie from a foreign website and importing a counterfeit movie DVD from a foreign company. For those foreign web sites that are determined after an investigation to be primarily and willfully infringing, the International Trade Commission will issue a “Cease and Desist” order. The “Cease and Desist” order may also be served on financial intermediaries that provide services to that foreign web site, compelling financial payment processors and online advertising providers to cease doing business with the foreign site in question. This would cut off financial incentives for this illegal activity and deter these unfair imports from reaching the U.S. market.\n\n*\\*facepalm\\**\n\nPay attention, because this is important: THIS IS ENTIRELY THE WRONG SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.\n\nThe entertainment industry has failed to innovate. They have failed to remain competitive. People want digital content. The entertainment industry has the opportunity to provide that to their customers. The fact that they often choose not to is not the fault of pirates. This is not the government’s problem to solve. Additional legislation is not the correct solution.\n\n\u003e The OPEN Act addresses the same challenges as the PROTECT IP Act, while protecting freedom of speech, innovation, and security on the Internet.\n\nHow, specifically?\n\n\u003e The challenge of rogue web sites is one that many nation’s face.\n\nProvide an objective definition of “rogue web site”. Also, you have a grammatical error here. You don’t use an apostrophe when pluralizing words — like “nation”.\n\n\u003e The United State has always been seen as a leader on Internet issues.\n\n*\\*blink\\**\n\nNo. No we have not. Especially in the 13 years since the Digital Revolution was ignited.\n\nAnd we are the “United States”, not the “United State”.\n\n\u003e Laws we establish in the United States regarding the Internet are likely to be used as models around the world.\n\nYou’re right. And the purpose of creating laws is (or rather, should be) to **protect** the freedoms of individual citizens, not to further **limit** our freedoms. Remember that.\n\n\u003e And because the Internet is global in nature, it is important that we carefully consider how the laws and policies we adopt in this area may be received and translated by other countries.\n\nPrecisely.\n\n\u003e Thank you again for contacting me to share your thoughts on this matter. You may also be interested in signing up for periodic updates for Washington State residents. If you are interested in subscribing to this update, please visit my website at http://cantwell.senate.gov. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of further assistance.\n\nSen. Cantwell, your lack of understanding of the core of the issue at hand makes me realize that you are not a person who truly represents the people of this state.\n\nYou will not be receiving a vote from me come election day.\n"},
