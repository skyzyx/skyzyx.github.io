There\u0026rsquo;s always some amount of time it takes to teach the recruiters how to identify what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for.

However, in the intervening years since I transitioned from a Front-End Engineer → Application Engineer → Site Reliability Engineer, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten busier, my kids have gotten older, and I quite frankly have other things to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I \u003cem\u003emay\u003c/em\u003e have heard of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t be offended or think I\u0026rsquo;m out-of-the-know if I haven\u0026rsquo;t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"address-and-phone-number-vs-your-blog-twitter-and-github\"\u003eAddress and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAddress:\u003c/strong\u003e I don’t need to know where you live.

Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live \u003cem\u003eon the Internet\u003c/em\u003e. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen Source or Free Software work is definitely a strong signal in your favor. Contributions to existing projects, or the open-sourcing of your own work — in non-trivial projects — is a very valuable skill to have. It shows me that you can play nicely inside an existing codebase. The fork-edit-PR workflow is an important part of how my team works, and having a background in that will make you more effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"objective\"\u003eObjective\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, this is near-universally worthless.

What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181114232624/http://noahstokes.com/hot-as-the-sun.php\"\u003eNoah Stokes\u003c/a\u003e’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick search, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people have adoped the \u003cstrong\u003e1-pager\u003c/strong\u003e style of résumé. I first came across this concept through my colleague \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdybenko/\"\u003eChristen Dybenko\u003c/a\u003e, who in-turn got the idea from a post by \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20181114232624/http://davidseah.com/blog/2008/07/powerpoint-resume-layout-tips/\"\u003eDavid Seah\u003c/a\u003e.

I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you.

This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[…] When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the time, this section doesn’t tell me anything because it tends to be packed with buzz-words or overzealous/unbelievable claims.

        "plain":"Over my career, my job title has typically fallen into the baskets of: Front-End Web Developer, Software Engineer, or DevOps/SRE. I’ve done a lot of interviewing to try and find the right people to join the teams I’ve worked on, and I thought it might be helpful to share part of my process. NOTE: I want to start by stating that what is written here are my own thoughts, and not representative of any past or current employer.\n Remastered? This is an updated and revised edition of my original piece from 2011, “The Hiring Process, Part I: What I Look For in a CV/Résumé”.\n  Over-arching Ideology There\u0026rsquo;s a dynamite quote from the book The Laws of Simplicity:\n Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.\n I first read this book in 2006, and it has changed my perspective on so many things. But if there\u0026rsquo;s one single idea you take from this piece, it should be to substract the obvious and add the meaningful.\nIt begins with a stack of résumés… Typically the process starts with a recruiter sending over a stack of résumés. There\u0026rsquo;s always some amount of time it takes to teach the recruiters how to identify what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for. My job is to make a determination as to whether or not this person is anything like what we\u0026rsquo;re looking to add to the team.\nNow, I’m going to start by saying that my approach to résumés is greatly influenced by \u0026ldquo;A Glimpse and a Hook\u0026rdquo; and the follow-up, \u0026ldquo;A Brief Glimpse\u0026rdquo;. Like the author, I generally update my résumé every 6–9 months whether I’m looking for a new gig or not.\nYour Name There was a time where if you’ve done something notable on the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP front, I’ve probably heard of you. However, in the intervening years since I transitioned from a Front-End Engineer → Application Engineer → Site Reliability Engineer, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten busier, my kids have gotten older, and I quite frankly have other things to think about.\nSo, I may have heard of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t be offended or think I\u0026rsquo;m out-of-the-know if I haven\u0026rsquo;t.\nAddress and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub Address: I don’t need to know where you live. I don’t care. I’m not going to mail you a letter.\nEmail: An email address is good at the very least. Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\nHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live on the Internet. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\nOpen Source or Free Software work is definitely a strong signal in your favor. Contributions to existing projects, or the open-sourcing of your own work — in non-trivial projects — is a very valuable skill to have. It shows me that you can play nicely inside an existing codebase. The fork-edit-PR workflow is an important part of how my team works, and having a background in that will make you more effective.\nObjective In my experience, this is near-universally worthless. It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\n “To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\n Well, no shit.\nElevator Pitch Your elevator pitch should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph.\nAssume that this is the only part of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\nIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is Noah Stokes’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick search, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\nSome people have adoped the 1-pager style of résumé. I first came across this concept through my colleague Christen Dybenko, who in-turn got the idea from a post by David Seah. This idea has also been made popular by sites like CV Parade. It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s great interviewers with a short attention span, but that isn\u0026rsquo;t me. I\u0026rsquo;m looking to understand what you actually know. If you include it, that\u0026rsquo;s cool, but it\u0026rsquo;s not a replacement for a real résumé.\nSkills and Software Skills are more important than software.\nLet me say that again: Skills are more important than software.\n  I care more about you being able to do something than I do about the tools you use to get there.\nBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\n “Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\n Bullshit.\nI recommend breaking your skills down into groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n  1–3: You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time, or they\u0026rsquo;re things that you\u0026rsquo;ve dabbled in and would like to dabble more.\n  4–6: You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n  7–9: You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n  10: You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n  Most people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\nThis is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\n Summary of Qualifications I think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n […] Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\n[…] When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n Most of the time, this section doesn’t tell me anything because it tends to be packed with buzz-words or overzealous/unbelievable claims. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \u0026ldquo;I work too hard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;My work is too perfect\u0026rdquo;, I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\nWork Experience   This is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n  I want to see what you accomplished (or where your focus was), what you learned, and how you’ve grown.\n  How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n  At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n  Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n  If you list an accomplishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n  Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n  Now, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\nReferences and Recommendations In white-collar jobs, references have gone the way of the dodo bird.\nThe thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\nNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light.

How well does it seem like they know you, and what kinds of things do they bring up about you? Do I see a recurring theme throughout all of your recommendations? How well do they mesh with how you’ve described yourself?\nOther Tips   Here are a few other things to think about:\nHave some skin in the game: I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work. They knew my reputation before they knew me. A huge bonus is if you’re already doing the thing that I’m trying to hire for.\nSound like a human being: If you say “planned, designed, and coordinated engineers efforts for the development of a mission critical system”, you sound like — no, just no. Only write stuff that will actually tell me something about you. Tell me about your process. Tell me about the issues you had to address. What kind of issues did you face?\nSpelling and Grammar: If you misspell wrods (see what I did there?) or have generally poor grammar, I’m going to move on. You\u0026rsquo;re an adult, presumably you graduated from high school, and you should be able to speak and write effectively. This especially applies to the following areas:\n Their, there, and they’re Then and than Lose and loose Except and accept Effect and affect And brand/product names: “I-phone” (instead of iPhone) and \u0026ldquo;MAC\u0026rdquo; (instead of Mac, or Macintosh, or macOS) is very, very wrong.  If you\u0026rsquo;re not going to take the time to get your writing right (especially on a résumé), what else are you not going to take the time to do?\nConclusion Now, I know that I don’t speak for everybody. Some people take a very different approach to reviewing résumés, and that’s fine. It’s also possible that I’m not the kind of person that you’d like to work with/for, and that’s fine too.\nI know that facets of my approach are used by people that I consider some of the best in the industry, and as such I’ve tried to learn from the best ideas I’ve come across to make the most informed decisions possible when determining whether or not to schedule the next step (i.e., the phone interview).\nIf you’re involved in creating things for the web, take heed to my suggestions.

It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\n\n\u003e “To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\n\nWell, no shit.\n\n## Elevator Pitch\n\nYour [elevator pitch]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch\" %}}) should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph.\n\nAssume that this is the **only part** of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\n\nIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is [Noah Stokes]({{% wayback \"http://noahstokes.com/hot-as-the-sun.php\" %}})’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick search, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\n\nSome people have adoped the **1-pager** style of résumé. I first came across this concept through my colleague [Christen Dybenko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdybenko/), who in-turn got the idea from a post by [David Seah]({{% wayback \"http://davidseah.com/blog/2008/07/powerpoint-resume-layout-tips/\" %}}). This idea has also been made popular by sites like [CV Parade]({{% wayback \"http://cvparade.com\" %}}). It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for.\n\nIt's great interviewers with a short attention span, but that isn't me. I'm looking to understand what you _actually know_. If you include it, that's cool, but it's not a replacement for a real résumé.\n\n## Skills and Software\n\nSkills are more important than software.\n\nLet me say that again: **Skills are more important than software.**\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/great-skills2.gif\" mp4=true alt=\"Girls only want boyfriends that have great skills!\"\u003e}}\n\nI care more about you _being able to do something_ than I do about the tools you use to get there.\n\nBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\n\n\u003e “Java, JavaScript, C\\#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\n\n_Bullshit_.\n\nI recommend breaking your skills down into groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n\n* **1–3:** You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time, or they're things that you've dabbled in and would like to dabble more.\n\n* **4–6:** You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n\n* **7–9:** You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n\n* **10:** You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n\nMost people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\n\n{{% aside %}}\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n{{% /aside %}}\n\n## Summary of Qualifications\n\nI think _Rands_ says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n\n\u003e […] Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\n\u003e\n\u003e […] When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n\nMost of the time, this section doesn’t tell me anything because it tends to be packed with buzz-words or overzealous/unbelievable claims. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\n\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \"I work _too_ hard\" or \"My work is _too_ perfect\", I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\n\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\n\n## Work Experience\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/stewie-work@2x.jpg\" alt=\"Stewie at work\" \u003e}}\n\nThis is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n\n* I want to see what you _accomplished_ (or where your _focus_ was), what you _learned_, and how you’ve _grown_.\n\n* How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n\n* At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n\n* Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n\n* If you list an accomplishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n\n* Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n\nNow, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\n\n## References and Recommendations\n\nIn white-collar jobs, references have gone the way of the dodo bird.\n\nThe thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\n\nNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light. In that way, a lot of recommendations are junk. Knowing that, I’m less concerned about positive or negative spin and more concerned with _what_ they write about you? What language do they use? How well does it seem like they know you, and what kinds of things do they bring up about you? Do I see a recurring theme throughout all of your recommendations? How well do they mesh with how you’ve described yourself?\n\n## Other Tips\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/spelling@2x.jpg\" alt=\"Spelling errors\" \u003e}}\n\nHere are a few other things to think about:\n\n**Have some skin in the game:** I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work. They knew _my reputation_ before they knew _me_. A huge bonus is if you’re already doing the thing that I’m trying to hire for.\n\n**Sound like a human being:** If you say “planned, designed, and coordinated engineers efforts for the development of a mission critical system”, you sound like — no, just no. Only write stuff that will actually tell me something about you. Tell me about your process. Tell me about the issues you had to address. What kind of issues did you face?\n\n**Spelling and Grammar:** If you misspell wrods (see what I did there?) or have generally poor grammar, I’m going to move on. You're an adult, presumably you graduated from high school, and you should be able to speak and write effectively. This especially applies to the following areas:\n\n* _Their_, _there_, and _they’re_\n* _Then_ and _than_\n* _Lose_ and _loose_\n* _Except_ and _accept_\n* _Effect_ and _affect_\n* And brand/product names: “I-phone” (instead of _iPhone_) and \"MAC\" (instead of _Mac_, or _Macintosh_, or _macOS_) is very, very wrong.\n\nIf you're not going to take the time to get your writing right (especially on a résumé), what else are you not going to take the time to do?\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNow, I know that I don’t speak for everybody. Some people take a very different approach to reviewing résumés, and that’s fine. It’s also possible that I’m not the kind of person that you’d like to work with/for, and that’s fine too.\n\nI know that facets of my approach are used by people that I consider some of the best in the industry, and as such I’ve tried to learn from the best ideas I’ve come across to make the most informed decisions possible when determining whether or not to schedule the next step (i.e., the phone interview).\n\nIf you’re involved in creating things for the web, take heed to my suggestions. Even if you don’t follow all of them, definitely make it a point to raise the quality of your résumé.\n"},

Save data is neither stored in the cloud with my Nintendo Network account, nor can I back it up onto an SD card. So my ideal future where I can throw my device in the ocean, buy a new one, and set it back up is still an impossibility — 18 months after the Switch shipped in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Nintendo still has the worst online account management system for games behind Apple, Microsoft, and Sony (in that order).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"normal-controllers\"\u003eNormal Controllers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what the “NX” was going to be, but it turned out to be a hybrid mobile/living room device. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of mobile gaming overall, so my Switch is usually connected to one of the TVs in the house. In the case of the \u003cem\u003eNintendo Switch Pro Controller\u003c/em\u003e, they actually did a very good job. It feels like a quality controller, and uses standard Bluetooth (which is an improvement over the Xbox controller).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/switch-pro-controller.webp\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch Pro Controller\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/switch-pro-controller.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch Pro Controller\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"figure-out-the-first-vs-third-party-game-situation\"\u003eFigure out the first vs. third-party game situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNintendo — with the Switch — has embraced third-party developers with such fervor, that they\u0026rsquo;ve cross into the \u003cem\u003ePerimeter of Wisdom\u003c/em\u003e, then back out the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Wii and Wii U, we had a handful of good games for the platform, then 95% \u003cem\u003eshovelware\u003c/em\u003e. With Switch, we\u0026rsquo;ve \u003cem\u003emostly\u003c/em\u003e seen good quality indie releases. But we\u0026rsquo;re also seeing things like \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180806025103/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/18/developers-publishers-react-to-nintendos-20-30-games-a-week-eshop-initiative\"\u003eNintendo\u0026rsquo;s 20-30 Games-a-Week Eshop Initiative\u003c/a\u003e. This is great for gamers, but terrible for developers. With that many titles coming in, many developers are likening it to the Steam store where there is virtually zero digital \u0026ldquo;shelf space\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo use American political figures as an example, I worry that they\u0026rsquo;ve jumped from \u003cem\u003eMitch McConnell\u003c/em\u003e (on the far-right), through the center, and all the way to \u003cem\u003eNanci Pelosi\u003c/em\u003e (on the far-left). Both places are bad places to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"embrace-digital-downloads\"\u003eEmbrace Digital Downloads\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the Xbox 360 and PS3 generation, I went about half downloads, and half disc for new games. In the time since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped buying discs and still get free digital games, so my collection currently leans squarely on the \u003cem\u003emostly-digital\u003c/em\u003e side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to do the same thing with the Wii and Wii U, but I couldn’t. I asked Nintendo to go all-in on digital, and allow us to have our Nintendo collections go all-digital. Did I get what I asked for? \u003cem\u003eSort of\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust about all Nintendo games are downloadable from the Nintendo Switch eShop, which is great. However… the Switch still only comes with 32 GB of (fast) internal storage, and offers (slower) micro-SD card support for expanded storage. Also, the Nintendo account situation (e.g., being able to re-download games to your second personal console) is still an unmitigated disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s like we asked Nintendo to build us a motorcycle. Stage one should have been a usable, functional \u003cem\u003etricycle\u003c/em\u003e. Instead we got a full-size motorcycle chassis and no engine. In other words, we\u0026rsquo;re somewhere on the path, but none of it works well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"pay-attention-to-your-competition\"\u003ePay Attention to your Competition\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple owns the largest video game platform in the world, but they don\u0026rsquo;t deserve it because they are \u003cem\u003eterrible\u003c/em\u003e caretakers of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/apple-tv-4k.webp\" alt=\"Apple TV 4K\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2018/apple-tv-4k.jpg\" alt=\"Apple TV 4K\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have been predicting since 2011 that Apple could release an Apple TV which would support apps, and have all of the really fantastic account management and app re-downloads available. If they chose to, they could decimate Nintendo in the console space. Apple finally did ship the Apple TV 4 which had a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an SDK to write apps with. But they failed to see the opportunity for gaming sitting in front of their faces, and now they\u0026rsquo;ve done little better than bomb in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith having ceded the \u003cem\u003egamer\u003c/em\u003e segment of the market to Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo is playing in the \u003cem\u003ecasual\u003c/em\u003e segment along with iOS developers (while Apple is off picking its nose in the corner somewhere).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Apple ever decides to get their act together on taking gaming seriously, I think that Nintendo would be toast. Apple is a very rich, very powerful competitor hanging out in the same segment as Nintendo is.

        "plain":"After reading Dear Nintendo…, a friend today asked me “How do you feel about the Switch?” Well, let's go down the list.   Nintendo Account   I can log into my account online, yes. Apparently, Nintendo Network ID is simply an OAuth provider for the rest of the Nintendo website. But you can also have a standalone Nintendo.com login. I deal with this stuff every day, and I still get confused on Nintendo\u0026rsquo;s website.\n  I have a Switch, a Wii U, the original 3DS, the original 3DS XL, and now the new clamshell 2DS XL. I am still only allowed to log into one Switch, one Wii U, and one device from the 2DS/3DS mobile family. As such, this issue is still not resolved.\n  I still cannot log into my U.S. Nintendo account on a Canadian Wii U console. (I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried with the Switch yet.) As such, this issue is still not resolved (as far as I have been able to test).\n  They finally joined the account balances across devices. This happened after the Switch shipped.\n  Lastly, games are still tied to consoles instead of accounts. Save data is neither stored in the cloud with my Nintendo Network account, nor can I back it up onto an SD card. So my ideal future where I can throw my device in the ocean, buy a new one, and set it back up is still an impossibility — 18 months after the Switch shipped in the U.S.\n  Ultimately, Nintendo still has the worst online account management system for games behind Apple, Microsoft, and Sony (in that order).\nNormal Controllers I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what the “NX” was going to be, but it turned out to be a hybrid mobile/living room device. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of mobile gaming overall, so my Switch is usually connected to one of the TVs in the house. In the case of the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, they actually did a very good job. It feels like a quality controller, and uses standard Bluetooth (which is an improvement over the Xbox controller).\n  Figure out the first vs. third-party game situation Nintendo — with the Switch — has embraced third-party developers with such fervor, that they\u0026rsquo;ve cross into the Perimeter of Wisdom, then back out the other side.\nWith the Wii and Wii U, we had a handful of good games for the platform, then 95% shovelware. With Switch, we\u0026rsquo;ve mostly seen good quality indie releases. But we\u0026rsquo;re also seeing things like Nintendo\u0026rsquo;s 20-30 Games-a-Week Eshop Initiative. This is great for gamers, but terrible for developers. With that many titles coming in, many developers are likening it to the Steam store where there is virtually zero digital \u0026ldquo;shelf space\u0026rdquo;.\nTo use American political figures as an example, I worry that they\u0026rsquo;ve jumped from Mitch McConnell (on the far-right), through the center, and all the way to Nanci Pelosi (on the far-left). Both places are bad places to be.\nEmbrace Digital Downloads During the Xbox 360 and PS3 generation, I went about half downloads, and half disc for new games. In the time since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve stopped buying discs and still get free digital games, so my collection currently leans squarely on the mostly-digital side.\nI wanted to do the same thing with the Wii and Wii U, but I couldn’t. I asked Nintendo to go all-in on digital, and allow us to have our Nintendo collections go all-digital. Did I get what I asked for? Sort of.\nJust about all Nintendo games are downloadable from the Nintendo Switch eShop, which is great. However… the Switch still only comes with 32 GB of (fast) internal storage, and offers (slower) micro-SD card support for expanded storage. Also, the Nintendo account situation (e.g., being able to re-download games to your second personal console) is still an unmitigated disaster.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s like we asked Nintendo to build us a motorcycle. Stage one should have been a usable, functional tricycle. Instead we got a full-size motorcycle chassis and no engine. In other words, we\u0026rsquo;re somewhere on the path, but none of it works well.\nPay Attention to your Competition Apple owns the largest video game platform in the world, but they don\u0026rsquo;t deserve it because they are terrible caretakers of it.\n  I have been predicting since 2011 that Apple could release an Apple TV which would support apps, and have all of the really fantastic account management and app re-downloads available. If they chose to, they could decimate Nintendo in the console space. Apple finally did ship the Apple TV 4 which had a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an SDK to write apps with. But they failed to see the opportunity for gaming sitting in front of their faces, and now they\u0026rsquo;ve done little better than bomb in the living room.\nWith having ceded the gamer segment of the market to Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo is playing in the casual segment along with iOS developers (while Apple is off picking its nose in the corner somewhere).\nIf Apple ever decides to get their act together on taking gaming seriously, I think that Nintendo would be toast. Apple is a very rich, very powerful competitor hanging out in the same segment as Nintendo is.

You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-wrapper\" data-streaming=\"youtube\" data-videoid=\"\" \u003e\n\t\u003ci class=\"icon-video-play-button shortcode\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"background-image:url(//img.youtube.com/vi//0.jpg)\" alt=\"YouTube Thumbnail\" class=\"video-thumbnail\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube. It was alright — if a bit gimmicky — but all was well in those days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wtf-wii\"\u003eWTF Wii?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that you sold a bajillion of them, and that was the beginning of your problems. You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/super-mario-galaxy.webp\" alt=\"Super Mario Galaxy\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/super-mario-galaxy.jpg\" alt=\"Super Mario Galaxy\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMetroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Smash Bros. Brawl\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Paper Mario\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNew Super Mario Bros.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e…and Donkey Kong Returns was pretty good.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8 good games on that console and everything else was crap. Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wii-u\"\u003eWii U\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"video-wrapper\" data-streaming=\"youtube\" data-videoid=\"\" \u003e\n\t\u003ci class=\"icon-video-play-button shortcode\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"background-image:url(//img.youtube.com/vi//0.jpg)\" alt=\"YouTube Thumbnail\" class=\"video-thumbnail\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES.

It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\n\n## What’s next with the NX?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/nx.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo NX\"\u003e}}\n\n### Nintendo Account\n\nStill, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\n\nFirst, figure out how to run a _freaking_ Nintendo account.\n\n1. I should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\n\n1. I should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\n\n1. Some of us live international lives. Allow me to log onto my child’s Canadian console using my U.S. account, so that I can continue using my game data (etc.) while spending time with my children in another country.\n\n1. There should not be separate balances for the Wii U store vs. the 3DS store. This is ridiculous. They should be the same store, the same account, the same money. I login, buy stuff, and play.\n\n1. Lastly, I should be able to throw my console in the ocean, buy a new one, log-in, and be able to re-download all of my games and settings.\n\nMicrosoft has this figured out. Apple has this figured out. Sony has this _(sorta)_ figured out. Why haven’t you been able to figure this out yet?\n\n### Normal Controllers\n\n_Please, for the love of god, stop making controllers “unique”_. I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/retro-fighters.jpg\" alt=\"Retro Fighters N64 controller\"\u003e}}\n\nGive us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware. Save that for games and gameplay, not hardware.\n\n### Figure out the first vs. third-party game situation\n\nNintendo hardware has been running a generation behind ever since the Wii was released in 2006. It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\n\nI’m sure that [Super Mario 3D World]({{\u003c wayback \"http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\" \u003e}}) doesn’t require as much processing power as [Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.callofduty.com/advancedwarfare\" \u003e}}), so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\n\nYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\n\nNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant. You make the best games for your own console. But — there are a few things to think about, because you’ve been sending mixed signals for a long time now.\n\n1. If you want to focus on making first-party games on Nintendo consoles, that’s great. But you need to _actually focus on making first-party games_. You didn’t do this for the first half of the Wii U’s existence.\n\n1. If you don’t want to put much effort into third-party games, that’s cool too — but say so. Stop allowing so much crapware to be sold for Nintendo consoles. But also remember that if the best third-party games are on a Sony or Microsoft console, and customers have a limited budget, who’s console are they going to buy?\n\n1. If you want to enable and support third-party developers, great! Then do it! Provide them support, help them to deliver the best possible gaming experiences, and ship hardware that is as powerful as the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.\n\n### Embrace Digital Downloads\n\nDigital downloads are _the now_, not just _the future_. Build out a world-class online store that can be accessed from TV consoles, handheld consoles, and computer Internet users alike. Focus on making downloads both fast and plentiful. Ship fewer and fewer games on disc, and instead ship larger hard drives that support expansion through external disks.\n\nEmbrace broadband, hard drives, digital downloads, and a world-class online store. You implemented the kids’ version of those things in the Wii U. Now build a modern version for grown-ups.\n\n### Pay Attention to your Competition\n\nAside from Nintendo, Apple is the only other company with small-screen (e.g., iOS) and large screen (e.g., macOS, tvOS) gaming platforms. Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK). They have way more users than Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony combined. They have powerful developer frameworks that enable game developers to build bigger, better, faster worlds.\n\nThe new Apple TV is squarely in your turf. No, they may not have their own Marios or Zeldas or Samuses, but their platform has enabled the likes of [Lili]({{\u003c wayback \"http://bitmonstergames.com/games/lili-child-of-geos/\" \u003e}}), [Oceanhorn]({{\u003c wayback \"https://oceanhorn.blogspot.com/\" \u003e}}), and [The Legend of Skyfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brKnX2zlTzE). They may not (yet) have the rich history of Nintendo’s characters, but it’s only a matter of time.\n\n{{\u003c yt brKnX2zlTzE \u003e}}\n\nRight now, Apple is focused on TV. And that’s probably good for you. But what happens when they ship an Apple TV “Pro” focused on gaming? They have an excellent SDK, an excellent games platform, the MFi Controller program, rock-solid account management, extremely fast game (i.e., “app”) downloads, and a dearth of end-users with limited funds for new game consoles?\n\n{{% aside %}}\nSee the follow-up, “[Dear Nintendo, Part II](/posts/2018/dear-nintendo-part-ii/)”\n{{% /aside %}}\n"},

If these guys prefer Android-based OSs and non-Apple hardware, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you’re in the business of reporting information, however, make sure you have your facts straight and aren’t misleading anybody by leaving out relevant information.\nAnything less than that is simply sloppy reporting.\n“Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs” In the recent episode entitled Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs, Mauricio Balvanera (producer) and Jackie Talbott (host) compare the new Apple iPhone 5 to the Samsung Galaxy S III in a number of factors. Here are some highlights:\nBeing pedantic First of all — and yes, I understand how completely pedantic I’m being — let’s break-down the accuracy of the title of the episode: “Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs”.\n  Apple is a company, which makes both the phone hardware, as well as the phone software.\n  Android is a base operating system, which hardware vendors take, modify, and re-release as their own custom operating systems. Android is built primarily by Google.\n  iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III are both (hardware) phones made by Apple and Samsung, respectively.\n Apple’s iPhone 5 runs iOS Samsung’s Galaxy S III runs Samsung’s modified version of the base Android OS. I have no idea what the product name of their custom OS is.    This is just plain sloppy.\nLeapfrogged  Mauricio: So we’re going to go over the technical differences between the two and basically decide whether or not Apple has leapfrogged Android technology.\n Has it already been decided that iOS has been leapfrogged by Android? If so, I wasn’t aware that this decision had been made. There are several cases where Apple and iOS have left other devices and mobile platforms in the dust. Were these not taken into account when the decision was made that Android was ahead?\nDevice size  Mauricio: So, the S III obviously takes the cake on size, while the iPhone beats out the S3 on thinness […]\n Yes, the S3 is physically larger. Does that mean it “wins”? I would argue not, but Mauricio seems to imply that requiring two hands is a feature. The be fair, however, he and Jackie both made it a point to mention that it can all boil down to a matter of preference, so there is neither a winner nor a loser here. Although I think they could have done a better job addressing this up-front, I’ll let this one slide.\nWhat they didn’t talk about, however, was the weight. The iPhone 5 feels considerably lighter than both the glass-backed 4 and 4S models, and clocks in at 3.95 ounces (112 grams). The Galaxy S III clocks in at just over 4.69 ounces (133 grams).\nNow, I own an iPhone 4 which clocks in at 4.8 ounces (137 grams). Various co-workers of mine have iPhone 4Ss, which clock in at 4.9 ounces (140 grams). The new iPhone 5 is 28g lighter than the 4S, and 25g lighter than the 4, and the difference in your hand is substantial. It would be reasonable to infer that being 21g lighter than the Galaxy S III would be nearly equally substantial.\nCamera There was too much banter here for me to transcribe, but they basically compare 8 MP to 8 MP with 1080p recording for each, and leave it at that. What they completely leave out is the quality of the lense, the aperture, low-light boosting, etc., which really make or break the quality of the photographs.\nNow, I’m not going to pretend to be a photography buff who knows the difference from one aperture size to another, but what about providing real-world photographs comparing one device to another to see what the real-world differences are?\nAnd that’s only for still shots. What about the quality of the recorded video? 1080p is a shorthand reference for 1920-by–1080 resolution; this has nothing to do with quality. And what about things like image stabilization during recording? I know first-hand that the last couple of iPhones have had awesome image stabilization. How does the Galaxy S III stack up?\nLightning port First, Mauricio makes a comment about replacing the old proprietary dock for a new proprietary dock (*womp, womp*) — implying that proprietary is inherently bad. Mauricio’s bias is showing.\nMauricio follows that up by explaining that the Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) Forum chose to endorse Micro USB for power and data transport in 2007. He also added that Apple was “notably absent.”\nThis reminds me of the story about how Teddy Roosevelt’s own mother didn’t even vote for him! Why does the OMTP story remind me of Teddy Roosevelt’s mother? Because both statements are both true and entirely misleading. What Mauricio leaves out of his explanation are some additional facts:\n  The OMTP forum was a collection of for-profit corporations, and not an unbiased standards organization.\n  The OMTP existed from 2004–2010. It no longer exists.\n  Micro USB was selected for power and data transfer — because those are the only two things that Micro USB is capable of.\n Apple’s 30-pin and Lightning connectors support video-out. Apple’s 30-pin and Lightning connectors support controlling the iDevice from another device (including stereos and car adapters). Apple’s 30-pin and Lightning connectors wrap additional functionality around the base USB 2.0 implementation.    Teddy Roosevelt was elected before 1918, when the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed to allow women to vote.\n  USB is a “dumb” protocol, and requires the primary machine’s CPU for any data transfer. FireWire, the 30-pin and Lightning connectors are much more intelligent protocols which use an on-board device processor, allowing for more efficient data transfer than Micro USB does — even over the same USB 2.0 protocol. Most USB 2.0 devices are lucky to get 280 Mbps (35 MB/s) of real-world throughput.\nNow, although the current version of the cables come in the USB 2.0 variety, do we know if the iPhone 5’s connector is capable of newer protocols such as USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt? I don’t know what the answer is, but it seems to me that starting with USB 2.0 support makes the most sense because that’s what the overwhelming number of customers have available.\nDuring a teardown of the iPhone 5 (which, to be fair, didn’t happen until after this episode of App Judgment was recorded), Ars Technica points out that Lightning might be USB 3.0-compatible. If the Lightning connector is supposed to last us another 10 years (as claimed by Apple), this seems to make the most sense.\nThings that are missing  No Micro SD […]\n Yay, because:\n Micro SD is more than 10x slower than the built-in SSD drives, and… Having multiple drives attached would complicate the UX of the device.   No NFC (Boo!) […]\n Near-Field Communication (NFC) is still (arguably) a solution in search of a problem. It’s a cart-before-the-horse situation. If NFC really does unlock some fantastic uses that make my life easier/better in some way, by all means, show them to me. I’d love to be proven wrong.\nPhil Schiller explains the majority of use-cases that people want NFC to fit are addressed by Passbook. Passbook is still new and apps are few (iOS 6 was released to the public only 11 days ago), but being an all-software solution means that developers can deliver new features quickly without requiring third-parties to purchase and integrate new NFC hardware.\nLet’s see which way the real-world usage actually goes. Realistically, it’s simply too early to tell.\n No Barometer […]\n What? How useful would such a feature be in the real world, when weather apps are a dime a dozen? I have no idea why this was on the list, other than to be a kitchen sink item.\n And no wireless charging capabilities.\n This would be an interesting feature in theory, but I’m not convinced that I’d want a bulkier phone in exchange for this feature. Also, when I plug in my phone to charge, I also want it to sync. While the iTunes WiFi Syncing in iOS 5 and later addresses this, it’s more important to me to have a faster connection while transferring data — especially with movies, TV shows and games that are typically in the 500 MB–2 GB range.\nSo, I’d argue that it’s an interesting feature, but I don’t know how well it’d work out practically.\nConclusion  Mauricio: Apple — at best — have matched Android hardware […]\n From there, they sit and mock Apple and new new stuff they recently put out. They did say that Apple’s build quality is better (it is, actually), but the rest was simply mocking.\nThey left out all of the software-related topics (since a piece of hardware is completely worthless without matching software), and they focused exclusively on hardware specs instead of actual features (also known as \u0026ldquo;feature checklist dysfunction)\u0026rdquo;.\nAll-in-all, I find myself so frustrated by such ill-informed reporting, that I’m rather put-off at the moment. I really hope that the hosts of App Judgment will avoid such opinion-filled, faux-reporting drivel in the future, and take the time to support their assertions with things like facts and empirical evidence. Tell the whole story, guys.\n",
        "source":"\nFor some time now, I’ve been a fan of the [App Judgment]({{% wayback \"http://revision3.com/appjudgment/\" %}}) podcast, which discusses new apps, devices and grades them on-air. Lately, however, I’ve noticed some saddeningly ill-informed “reporting” when it comes to Apple, iOS 6 and the new iPhone 5.\n\n## Bias is bias\n\nFirst of all, everybody is free to have their own opinions. If these guys prefer Android-based OSs and non-Apple hardware, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you’re in the business of reporting information, however, make sure you have your facts straight and aren’t misleading anybody by leaving out relevant information.\n\nAnything less than that is simply sloppy reporting.\n\n## “Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs”\n\nIn the recent episode entitled [Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs]({{% wayback \"http://revision3.com/appjudgment/iphone5-vs-galaxys3\" %}}), [Mauricio Balvanera]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/maubrowncow\" %}}) (producer) and [Jackie Talbott]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/jackietalbott\" %}}) (host) compare the new [Apple iPhone 5]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\" %}}) to the [Samsung Galaxy S III]({{% wayback \"http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxys3/\" %}}) in a number of factors. Here are some highlights:\n\n## Being pedantic\n\nFirst of all — and yes, I understand how completely pedantic I’m being — let’s break-down the accuracy of the title of the episode: “Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs”.\n\n* *Apple* is a company, which makes both the phone hardware, as well as the phone software.\n\n* *Android* is a base operating system, which hardware vendors take, modify, and re-release as their own custom operating systems. Android is built primarily by Google.\n\n* *iPhone 5* and *Galaxy S III* are both (hardware) phones made by Apple and Samsung, respectively.\n    * Apple’s iPhone 5 runs *iOS*\n    * Samsung’s Galaxy S III runs Samsung’s modified version of the base Android OS. I have no idea what the product name of their custom OS is.\n\nThis is just plain sloppy.\n\n## Leapfrogged\n\n\u003e Mauricio: So we’re going to go over the technical differences between the two and basically decide whether or not Apple has leapfrogged Android technology.\n\nHas it already been decided that iOS has been leapfrogged by Android? If so, I wasn’t aware that this decision had been made. There are [several cases](/2011/09/05/skating-to-where-the-puck-will-be/) where Apple and iOS have left other devices and mobile platforms in the dust. Were these not taken into account when the decision was made that Android was ahead?\n\n## Device size\n\n\u003e Mauricio: So, the S III obviously takes the cake on size, while the iPhone beats out the S3 on thinness \\[…\\]\n\nYes, the S3 is physically larger. Does that mean it “wins”? I would argue not, but Mauricio seems to imply that requiring two hands is a *feature*. The be fair, however, he and Jackie both made it a point to mention that it can all boil down to a matter of preference, so there is neither a winner nor a loser here. Although I think they could have done a better job addressing this up-front, I’ll let this one slide.\n\nWhat they didn’t talk about, however, was the weight. The iPhone 5 *feels* considerably lighter than both the glass-backed 4 and 4S models, and clocks in at 3.95 ounces (112 grams). The Galaxy S III clocks in at just over 4.69 ounces (133 grams).\n\nNow, I own an iPhone 4 which clocks in at [4.8 ounces (137 grams)]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4/specs.html\" %}}). Various co-workers of mine have iPhone 4Ss, which clock in at [4.9 ounces (140 grams)]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4s/specs.html\" %}}). The new iPhone 5 is 28g lighter than the 4S, and 25g lighter than the 4, and the difference in your hand is _substantial_. It would be reasonable to infer that being 21g lighter than the Galaxy S III would be nearly equally substantial.\n\n## Camera\n\nThere was too much banter here for me to transcribe, but they basically compare 8 MP to 8 MP with 1080p recording for each, and leave it at that. What they completely leave out is the quality of the lense, the aperture, low-light boosting, etc., which really make or break the quality of the photographs.\n\nNow, I’m not going to pretend to be a photography buff who knows the difference from one aperture size to another, but what about providing real-world photographs comparing one device to another to see what the real-world differences are?\n\nAnd that’s only for still shots. What about the quality of the recorded video? 1080p is a shorthand reference for 1920-by–1080 *resolution*; this has nothing to do with *quality*. And what about things like image stabilization during recording? I know first-hand that the last couple of iPhones have had awesome image stabilization. How does the Galaxy S III stack up?\n\n## Lightning port\n\nFirst, Mauricio makes a comment about replacing the old proprietary dock for a new proprietary dock (*\\*womp, womp\\**) — implying that proprietary is inherently bad.

The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail.

        "plain":"Reed Hastings seems like a bright guy. He handily trounced the incumbent DVD rental giants (e.g., Blockbuster, Hollywood Video), and currently has a commanding lead in the movie streaming market. So why on earth is he destroying what he’s built?\n  What’s happening to Netflix? Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, recently wrote a blog post to customers about some upcoming changes to the Netflix we know today:\n It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\n Translation: “We’re sorry that we did a poor job of telling you bad news, but the bad news was going to happen no matter what.”\n Many members love our DVD service, as I do, because nearly every movie ever made is published on DVD, plus lots of TV series. We want to advertise the breadth of our incredible DVD offering so that as many people as possible know it still exists, and it is a great option for those who want the huge and comprehensive selection on DVD.\n “We have a crap-ton of content available on DVD.”\n DVD by mail may not last forever, but we want it to last as long as possible.\n “DVDs by mail is a dying business.”\n I also love our streaming service because it is integrated into my TV, and I can watch anytime I want. The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail. We feel we need to focus on rapid improvement as streaming technology and the market evolve, without having to maintain compatibility with our DVD by mail service.\n “DVDs are old and busted. Streaming is the new hotness — the new shiny.”\n So we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.\n “Blah, blah, internal corporate structure, blah.”\n It’s hard for me to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary and best: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”.\n “I’m retarded.”\n A negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated. So if you subscribe to both services, and if you need to change your credit card or email address, you would need to do it in two places. Similarly, if you rate or review a movie on Qwikster, it doesn’t show up on Netflix, and vice-versa.\n “Nevermind that web services and data integration are commonplace across the web in this day and age. Bring back the 90’s!”\n The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n Let’s bookmark this.\nThe Reaction The reaction is overwhelmingly negative, from tech industry insiders and non-techies alike.\n  When I first read Reed’s blog post on Sunday night, there were 245 comments. This morning, there were 11,237 comments. As I write this, there are 21,747 21,872 comments — nearly every single one of them is outraged by what this means for customers.\nAs usual, Twitter is aflutter with comments.\nDeanna Raybourn:\nSo Netflix nearly doubles prices, and--by way of apology--makes doing business with them twice as time-consuming and inconvenient? Superb.\n\u0026mdash; Deanna Raybourn (@deannaraybourn) September 19, 2011 Paul Medico:\nAnnouncing a new company/brand with an apology is not a great way to instill confidence in your investors. #qwikster #netflix\n\u0026mdash; Paul Medico (@PaulMedico) September 19, 2011 Ben Zibble:\nNetflix: \u0026quot;we heard you don\u0026#39;t like paying more for dvd+streaming, so we\u0026#39;re also going to make them not work together anymore. You\u0026#39;re welcome\u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash; Ben Zibble (@bzibble) September 19, 2011 Matt Dudley (deleted):\n Imagine if @Netflix and Qwikster combined services… unlimited DVD rentals and streaming. Now THAT would be awesome.\n And here’s my personal favorite, from Wonderella:\nI just got an email from Netflix\u0026#39;s CEO telling me to - and I\u0026#39;m paraphrasing - \u0026quot;Please start torrenting\u0026quot;.\n\u0026mdash; Simply Having a Wonderella Christmastime (@wonderella) September 19, 2011 (Bonus: The Oatmeal and The Joy of Tech chime in.)\nPersonally, I’ve not only been a Netflix customer for a long time (since 2005-ish), but I’ve also been a Netflix fan. I didn’t mind so much when they split up the DVD/streaming accounts and started charging a little more. Netflix + Hulu has completely replaced my cable package.\nI suppose my concerns are mostly around the usability of everything. There are lots of third-party services trying to make it easier to watch what you want, regardless of the service. I look up movie/show descriptions on IMDb, movie posters from The Movie DB, stream content from Hulu or Netflix, download content from iTunes, or get a DVD by mail from Netflix (for titles that aren’t available digitally). I would love to see more integration, rather than fragmenting the services even more.\nA Fundamental Change in the Product Joshua Porter of Bokardo.com had this to say:\n Netflix is taking a huge risk here. They’re changing the user experience of their web apps to model the new company structure, not a structure that is most friendly to people. This is an extremely common problem in user interface design. Netflix is in serious danger of breaking the user experience they are well-known for.\n If you read through even a fraction of comments on the aforementioned Netflix blog post, a very large percentage of users agree with this analysis. Almost everybody has the same concern.\n   As one commenter complains there will now be two separate movie queues, one on Netflix for DVD and one on Qwikster for streaming. Hastings’ response is dismissive:\n We already have two queues. The two “sites” are a click between each other, so we think not that much different than two tabs on one site.\n Technically, Hastings is right about there already being two queues. But he’s dead wrong about it being much different. Obviously he’s never watched people use web applications before. Changing websites is not even close to the same thing as changing tabs. When you change websites you go somewhere different, you get a different UI, you’re using a different username, and you probably have to log in. You have a different payment system. Different family members to add. Different recommendations to look at. And that’s just for starters. […]\nThis is a fundamental change in the product, and Hastings just dismisses the concern with a wave of his hand.\n Clearly, the team at Netflix — known for its engineering prowess — has overlooked how its “not that much different” changes will affect the overall customer experience.\n Also, people don’t think they’re buying two services right now…they’re simply buying Netflix. As another commenter points out:\n You’re continuing to make a classic mistake: thinking you’re something different than what everyone believes you are. You’re not a DVD company and a streaming company: you’re where I go to watch movies. That’s it. The future clearly is streaming, but by separating and charging more for access, you’re wildly less valuable to me. I’ll likely cancel. You haven’t listened to customer feedback. You’re delusional and you’re lost.\u0026quot;\n  Railroad companies failed to understand that they were in the transportation business and were surpassed by the airlines. Newspaper companies failed to understand that they were in the information business and were surpassed by blogs. Record stores failed to understand that they were in the business of selling music and the were surpassed by the Napster Revolution. It’s a classic mistake.\nCatalog Size, Deintegration and Price-Hikes — Oh My! Netflix’ current streaming selection is, at best, abysmal. A couple of months ago, I was getting ready to move and decided to digitize my DVD collection so that I wouldn’t have to drag them along with me. I figured that most of my movies would be available for streaming, so that would save me the time of digitizing the DVDs that I didn’t need to.\nAs it turned out, I ended up having to digitize the majority of my DVDs because they weren’t available for streaming. I’m still working my way through the stack.\n  Earlier in the summer, Netflix decided to separate the DVD and streaming plans into separate offerings, with separate pricing for each. Despite Netflix’ best efforts to spin it positively, customers didn’t buy the explanation. Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch said it best:\n Raising prices for those of us who opt for both streaming and DVDs would have been fine if Netflix had a deeper streaming catalog. But the gap is still too big, and the price hike seemed premature. Your customers are extremely loyal. Don’t piss them off.\n (Aside: Bill Gurley from Above the Crowd makes a very interesting case for why he believes Netflix was forced to raise their prices. I would likely end up quoting his entire piece here, so I’ll just link to \u0026ldquo;Understanding Why Netflix Changed Pricing\u0026rdquo; instead.)\nA few months before that, Netflix removed the ability for customers to add movies to their DVD queues from non-computer devices. If you look up a movie on your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii or other non-computer device, and it isn’t available for streaming, you need to do the search all over again from your computer before you can add it to your queue.\nNow Netflix is looking to make a move that is making customers even angrier: Not only are they separating the DVD and streaming queues into separate websites, but they’re also separating user accounts, credit card updates, ratings, reviews, recommendations, and everything else. Instead of the simplicity of one location for your movies, you now have to deal with two.\nWhither Qwikster? Back to Reed Hastings’ blog post:\n Andy Rendich, who has been working on our DVD service for 12 years, and leading it for the last 4 years, will be the CEO of Qwikster. Andy and I made a short welcome video. (You’ll probably say we should avoid going into movie making after watching it.) We will let you know in a few weeks when the Qwikster.com website is up and ready. It is merely a renamed version of the Netflix DVD website, but with the addition of video games.

Netflix will offer the best streaming service for TV shows and movies, hopefully on a global basis.\n Streaming is the future. Everybody knows it. You know it, I know it, Reed Hastings knows it, and Andy Rendich sure as heck knows it. When was the last time you decided to add a movie to your DVD queue if it was already available for streaming? When is streaming ever not your first choice?\n  Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch breaks down the numbers:\n Still, it’s not enough to offset the drop-off in DVD subscribers. Of the 1 million fewer subscribers Netflix now expects, 800,000 will be from DVD-only subscribers. The remaining 200,000 decline will come from streaming-only subs, with the number who pay for both remaining steady. Out of Netflix’s expected 24 million subscribers this year, 21.8 million will have access to streaming in some form, and only 2.2 million will stick to DVD-only subscriptions.\n That doesn’t sound like a very large business. As a matter of fact, that’s a business that’s shrinking. Surely Andy Rendich has seen these numbers, so why would he agree to become the new CEO of a born-to-fail business?\nCrazy or Genius? Looking at this series of events from the outside, I can only see two possible rationales that explain why they’re doing what they’re doing.\n They’re bat-shit crazy. They know something that we don’t, which will make all of this headache worth it.  Reed Hastings and Co. have always seemed like a sharp bunch. They started the company with the notion of putting the customer first and over time they have built a successful business around that premise.\n  Recently, Netflix and Starz decided to end their business relationship, yet Reed Hastings said:\n The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n I can’t help but compare present-day Netflix to Apple in 1985.

Almost everybody has the same concern.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/change.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" \u003e}}\n\n\u003e As one commenter complains there will now be two separate movie queues, one on Netflix for DVD and one on Qwikster for streaming. Hastings’ response is dismissive:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e We already have two queues. The two “sites” are a click between each other, so we think not that much different than two tabs on one site.\n\u003e\n\u003e Technically, Hastings is right about there already being two queues. But he’s dead wrong about it being much different. Obviously he’s never watched people use web applications before. Changing websites is not even close to the same thing as changing tabs. When you change websites you go somewhere different, you get a different UI, you’re using a different username, and you probably have to log in. You have a different payment system. Different family members to add. Different recommendations to look at. And that’s just for starters. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e This is a fundamental change in the product, and Hastings just dismisses the concern with a wave of his hand.\n\nClearly, the team at Netflix — known for its engineering prowess — has overlooked how its “not that much different” changes will affect the overall customer experience.\n\n\u003e Also, people don’t think they’re buying two services right now…they’re simply buying Netflix. As another commenter points out:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e You’re continuing to make a classic mistake: thinking you’re something different than what everyone believes you are. You’re not a DVD company and a streaming company: you’re where I go to watch movies. That’s it. The future clearly is streaming, but by separating and charging more for access, you’re wildly less valuable to me. I’ll likely cancel. You haven’t listened to customer feedback. You’re delusional and you’re lost.\"\n\nRailroad companies failed to understand that they were in the transportation business and were surpassed by the airlines. Newspaper companies failed to understand that they were in the information business and were surpassed by blogs. Record stores failed to understand that they were in the business of selling music and the were surpassed by the Napster Revolution. It’s a classic mistake.\n\n## Catalog Size, Deintegration and Price-Hikes — Oh My!\n\nNetflix’ current streaming selection is, at best, *abysmal*. A couple of months ago, I was getting ready to move and decided to digitize my DVD collection so that I wouldn’t have to drag them along with me. I figured that most of my movies would be available for streaming, so that would save me the time of digitizing the DVDs that I didn’t need to.\n\nAs it turned out, I ended up having to digitize the *majority* of my DVDs because they weren’t available for streaming. I’m *still* working my way through the stack.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ipod.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"210\" \u003e}}\n\nEarlier in the summer, Netflix decided to separate the DVD and streaming plans into separate offerings, with separate pricing for each. Despite Netflix’ best efforts to spin it positively, customers didn’t buy the explanation. Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch [said it best]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/netflix-wall-street/\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Raising prices for those of us who opt for both streaming and DVDs would have been fine if Netflix had a deeper streaming catalog. But the gap is still too big, and the price hike seemed premature. Your customers are extremely loyal. Don’t piss them off.\n\n(Aside: Bill Gurley from [Above the Crowd]({{% wayback \"http://abovethecrowd.com\" %}}) makes a very interesting case for why he believes Netflix was forced to raise their prices. I would likely end up quoting his entire piece here, so I’ll just link to \"[Understanding Why Netflix Changed Pricing]({{% wayback \"http://abovethecrowd.com/2011/09/18/understanding-why-netflix-changed-pricing/\" %}})\" instead.)\n\nA few months before that, Netflix removed the ability for customers to add movies to their DVD queues from non-computer devices. If you look up a movie on your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii or other non-computer device, and it isn’t available for streaming, you need to do the search all over again from your computer before you can add it to your queue.\n\nNow Netflix is looking to make a move that is making customers even angrier: Not only are they separating the DVD and streaming queues into separate websites, but they’re also separating user accounts, credit card updates, ratings, reviews, recommendations, and everything else. Instead of the simplicity of one location for your movies, you now have to deal with two.\n\n## Whither Qwikster?\n\nBack to Reed Hastings’ blog post:\n\n\u003e Andy Rendich, who has been working on our DVD service for 12 years, and leading it for the last 4 years, will be the CEO of Qwikster. Andy and I made a short welcome video. (You’ll probably say we should avoid going into movie making after watching it.) We will let you know in a few weeks when the Qwikster.com website is up and ready. It is merely a renamed version of the Netflix DVD website, but with the addition of video games. You won’t have to do anything special if you subscribe to our DVD by mail service. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Some members will likely feel that we shouldn’t split the businesses, and that we shouldn’t rename our DVD by mail service. \\[…\\] But going forward, Qwikster will continue to run the best DVD by mail service ever, throughout the United States. Netflix will offer the best streaming service for TV shows and movies, hopefully on a global basis.\n\nStreaming is the future. Everybody knows it. You know it, I know it, Reed Hastings knows it, and Andy Rendich sure as heck knows it. When was the last time you decided to add a movie to your DVD queue if it was already available for streaming? When is streaming ever *not* your first choice?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/qwikster.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"273\" \u003e}}\n\nErick Schonfeld of Techcrunch [breaks down the numbers]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/netflix-wall-street/\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Still, it’s not enough to offset the drop-off in DVD subscribers. Of the 1 million fewer subscribers Netflix now expects, 800,000 will be from DVD-only subscribers. The remaining 200,000 decline will come from streaming-only subs, with the number who pay for both remaining steady. Out of Netflix’s expected 24 million subscribers this year, 21.8 million will have access to streaming in some form, and only 2.2 million will stick to DVD-only subscriptions.\n\nThat doesn’t sound like a very large business. As a matter of fact, that’s a business that’s *shrinking*. Surely Andy Rendich has seen these numbers, so why would he agree to become the new CEO of a born-to-fail business?\n\n## Crazy or Genius?\n\nLooking at this series of events from the outside, I can only see two possible rationales that explain why they’re doing what they’re doing.\n\n1. They’re bat-shit crazy.\n2. They know something that we don’t, which will make all of this headache worth it.\n\nReed Hastings and Co. have always seemed like a sharp bunch. They started the company with the notion of putting the customer first and over time they have built a successful business around that premise.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/einstein-crazy.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" \u003e}}\n\nRecently, Netflix and [Starz]({{% wayback \"http://starz.com\" %}}) decided to end their business relationship, yet Reed Hastings said:\n\n\u003e The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n\nI can’t help but compare present-day Netflix to Apple in 1985. The Macintosh was clearly the future of computing, but after a solid start, sales were starting to drop off. There weren’t enough applications and the hardware was considered too expensive. The Apple II, on the other hand, was a cash-cow with a large application library at its disposal. Steve Jobs ended up losing his job over the “failure” of the Macintosh. Fast-forward to today: Macs are selling like hotcakes — faster than the entire computer industry — and the *Apple* line of computers died out 25 years ago.\n\nI think Netflix currently finds itself in a similar position. They know that streaming is the future, if not the *now*. They are working to grow their streaming content library every day. No, the amount of content comes nowhere near that of their DVDs-by-mail business, but it will.\n\nQwikster will eventually fade into a footnote in history — and I believe that this has been the plan all along. What better way to sunset the legacy product and grow the new product than to remove the distractions entirely? All of the built-up brand equity is staying with their newer product, streaming video, while the legacy product gets pushed out the back door with a stupid name and a $20-bill pinned to its collar. This isn’t an accident.\n\nI hope that the team at Netflix continues to ride the fine line between crazy and genius for all it’s worth. That said, I can’t help but feel that in their rush to move into the future, they’re *bungling* the present. Hastings and Rendich need to take a moment to slow down, listen to what customers *want* (instead of just what they’re *asking for*), and make this transition from DVDs to streaming as smooth as possible.\n"},

A recently-discovered attack by an Iranian hacker has thwarted the industry-standard approach to online security, causing browser makers and security firms to scramble to restore balance.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ssl-secure.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n## What is a web browser?\n\nNot sure what a web browser is? Check out [WhatBrowser.org]({{% wayback \"http://www.whatbrowser.org\" %}}), watch the video, then come back here.\n\nReady? Good.\n\n## Let me tell you a story…\n\nLet’s say you’re visit a new place, and you have this really cool cab driver driving you around so that you can go site-seeing. This cab driver has agreed to be like a tour guide, taking you wherever you want to go so that you can explore all of the interesting (web)sites. This driver — let’s call him Mr. Firefox — takes you all sorts of places that you want to go. He always knows the best routes to take, and always makes sure you get there safely. As your cab driver, you *trust* that he will get you there safely.\n\nFollowing me so far?\n\nBut there’s something you don’t know about Mr. Firefox: He’s retarded. Like, completely and utterly retarded. Like, little yellow school bus retarded. If you told him to drive into the lake, he would. He’s that stupid.\n\nOn the up-shot, Mr. Firefox knows that he’s retarded, so to deal with this he surrounds himself with a bunch of really good people that he knows he can *trust*. These people — let’s call them the Authorities — look out for him, and teach him which places are safe and which are not. This way, if you were to ask Mr. Firefox to drive into a lake, he would know that this is a bad idea and won’t do it (or will at least tell you how bad of an idea it is).\n\n## A dirty cop\n\nNow, what if it was discovered that one of these Authorities was a dirty cop? This dirty cop has been taking bribes from Iranian terrorists to tell Mr. Firefox that it’s perfectly safe to drive you into a lake. Or that the bridge that was under construction is finally ready to drive across, when really it would collapse. Even though you don’t have a gun being waved in your face, you’re still in danger even though you can’t see it.\n\nYou *trust* your cab driver, who *trusts* the Authorities — one of which is a lying douchebag.\n\n## It really happened!\n\nWell, this is what has happened to the Internet over the past few weeks. You *trust* your web browser, your web browser *trusts* the Certificate Authorities, and two of these Certificate Authorities were hacked by Iranian terrorists. These terrorists generated security certificates so that they could *impersonate* and *eavesdrop* on sites you know and love: Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, Google, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Mozilla, and even the C.I.A. Over ~~250~~ **511** sites in all are affected by this (and still counting).\n\nTo stay safe, browser makers (Mozilla, Microsoft, Google and Apple) have started issuing updates that revoke their trust for these hacked Certificate Authorities. As such, you need to make sure you’re running the very latest version of your web browser.\n\n## How do I stay safe?\n\nThe best way to stay safe is to update your browser to the very latest version. If you’re not sure what browser you’re running, check out [WhatBrowser.org]({{% wayback \"http://www.whatbrowser.org\" %}}). It will tell you.\n\n* If you have a computer running **Microsoft Windows** and/or are running the **Internet Explorer** web browser, make sure you run Microsoft Update (formerly Windows Update) and install all of the available updates — specifically [Security Advisory 2607712]({{% wayback \"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2607712\" %}}).\n\n* If you have a computer running **Mac OS X** and/or are running the **Safari** web browser, make sure you run Software Update and install all of the available updates — specifically [Security Update 2011–005]({{% wayback \"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4920\" %}}).\n\n* If you’re running the **Mozilla Firefox** web browser, make sure you update to the latest version (6.0.2 at the time of this writing).\n\n* If you’re running the **Google Chrome** web browser, you get automatic updates, so you probably don’t have a lot to worry about.\n\n## Where can I learn more?\n\nHere are some links about what has happened.

Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like \u003ccode\u003efind\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003egrep\u003c/code\u003e, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary-of-qualifications\"\u003eSummary of Qualifications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing.

        "plain":"Over my career, my job title has typically fallen into one of two baskets: Front-End Web Developer or Software Engineer. I’ve done a lot of interviewing over the past several years to try and find the right people to join the teams I’ve worked on, and I thought it might be helpful to share part of my process. NOTE: I want to start by stating that what is written here are my own thoughts, and not representative of any past or current employer.\n Start Typically the process starts with an in-house recruiter sending a stack of résumés to my manager. My managers have usually taken a swag at filtering out the ones that are clearly junk, and then pass them off to me to make a determination as to whether someone is worth a phone call for the position.\nNow, I’m going to start by saying that my approach to résumés is greatly influenced by \u0026ldquo;A Glimpse and a Hook\u0026rdquo; and the follow-up, \u0026ldquo;A Brief Glimpse\u0026rdquo;. Like the author, I update my résumé every 3–6 months whether I’m looking for a new gig or not.\nYour Name I’ve been around. You might call me an Internet slut. If you’ve done something notable on the Front-End/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP front, I’ve probably heard of you. That’s already going to be a plus.\nAddress and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub I don’t need to know where you live. I don’t care. I’m not going to mail you a letter. An email address is good at the very least. Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\nHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live on the Internet. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/SourceForge/Google Code account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\nNot having these — as a Web or PHP developer — is a red flag for me. I wouldn’t necessarily expect someone with a Java or .NET background to use Twitter or GitHub (nothing against Java or .NET developers). But if you’re working in PHP, Ruby or the front-end, I expect to see these things otherwise I’m going to suspect that you’re out of touch with what’s happening right now.\nObjective If you have this on your résumé, get rid of it. It sucks. It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\n “To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\n Well, no shit.\nElevator Pitch Your elevator pitch should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph. Assume that this is the only part of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\nIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is Noah Stokes’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick Google, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\nAlternatively, I’m also a fan of the 1-pager. I first came across this concept through my colleague Christen Dybenko, who in-turn got the idea from a post by David Seah. This idea has also been made popular by sites like CV Parade. It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for. It isn’t a résumé replacement, but it’s a good way for you to hook my interest.\nSome sites make this easy for you; About.me and Zerply come immediately to mind.\nSkills and Software Skills are more important than software. I care more about you being able to do something than I do about the tools you use to get there.\nBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\n “Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\n Bullshit.\nI recommend breaking your skills down into three groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n  1–3: You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time.\n  4–6: You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n  7–9: You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n  10: You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n  Most people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\nIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like find, grep, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\nAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\nSummary of Qualifications I think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n Similar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\nUnlike Skills, which I find to be a total waste of time, I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking. When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n Most of the time, it’s a bunch of junk that doesn’t tell me anything. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \u0026ldquo;I work too hard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;My work is too perfect\u0026rdquo;, I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\nMe? I have a strong personality and sometimes I steamroll over people if I’m not paying attention. If the team I’m applying for is comprised primarily of easy-going and/or delicate personalities, I probably won’t be a good fit for your team. But if you’re looking for someone who has the backbone to make a decision and commit, and have other people on the team with strong personalities who like to hash out ideas to find the best ones, then I’m likely a great fit.\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\nWork Experience This is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n  I want to see what you accomplished (or where your focus was), what you learned, and how you’ve grown.\n  How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n  At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n  Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n  If you list an accomlishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n  Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n  Now, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\nReferences and Recommendations References have gone the way of the dodo bird. The thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations.

But understand that you’re in the minority.\nOther Tips Here are a few other things to think about:\nGitHub \u0026gt; Résumé: A GitHub account is better than a résumé. I’ll learn more from looking at your code and the kinds of things you like to work on than I ever will by looking over your résumé.\nHave some skin in the game: I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work.

On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n\n* **1–3:** You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time.\n\n* **4–6:** You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n\n* **7–9:** You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n\n* **10:** You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n\nMost people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\n\nIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like `find`, `grep`, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\n\nAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\n\n## Summary of Qualifications\n\nI think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n\n\u003e Similar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\n\u003e\n\u003e Unlike Skills, which I find to be a total waste of time, I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking. When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n\nMost of the time, it’s a bunch of junk that doesn’t tell me anything. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\n\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \"I work *too* hard\" or \"My work is *too* perfect\", I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\n\nMe? I have a strong personality and sometimes I steamroll over people if I’m not paying attention. If the team I’m applying for is comprised primarily of easy-going and/or *delicate* personalities, I probably won’t be a good fit for your team. But if you’re looking for someone who has the backbone to make a decision and commit, and have other people on the team with strong personalities who like to hash out ideas to find the best ones, then I’m likely a great fit.\n\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\n\n## Work Experience\n\nThis is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n\n* I want to see what you *accomplished* (or where your *focus* was), what you *learned*, and how you’ve *grown*.\n\n* How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n\n* At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n\n* Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n\n* If you list an accomlishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n\n* Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n\nNow, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\n\n## References and Recommendations\n\nReferences have gone the way of the dodo bird. The thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\n\nNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light. In that way, a lot of recommendations are junk. Knowing that, I’m less concerned about positive or negative spin and more concerned with *what* they write about you? What language do they use? How well does it seem like they know you, and what kinds of things do they bring up about you? Do I see a recurring theme throughout all of your recommendations? How well do they mesh with how you’ve described yourself?\n\n## Education\n\nGenerally, I completely skip this section. The only thing I check for is whether or not you have a Master’s degree. What my personal experience has taught me is that a Master’s degree means very little real-world experience, and the experience that they *do* have is generally pretty useless.\n\nNow, if you have your Master’s degree *and* know your stuff, then that’s great. But understand that you’re in the minority.\n\n## Other Tips\n\nHere are a few other things to think about:\n\n**GitHub \u0026gt; Résumé:** A GitHub account is better than a résumé. I’ll learn more from looking at your code and the kinds of things you like to work on than I ever will by looking over your résumé.\n\n**Have some skin in the game:** I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work. They knew *my reputation* before they knew *me*. A huge bonus is if you’re already doing the thing that I’m trying to hire for.\n\n**Sound like a human being:** If you say “planned, designed, and coordinated engineers efforts for the development of a mission critical system”, you sound like a jargon machine more than a human being. Only write stuff that will actually tell me something about you. No mumbo-jumbo.\n\n**Spelling and Grammar:** If you misspell something or have generally poor grammar, I’m going to move on. Sorry. This especially applies to the following areas:\n\n* Their, there, and they’re\n* Then and than\n* Lose and loose\n* And brand/product names: “I-phone” is very, very wrong.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNow, I know that I don’t speak for everybody. Some people take a very different approach to reviewing résumés, and that’s fine. It’s also possible that I’m not the kind of person that you’d like to work with/for, and that’s fine too.\n\nI know that facets of my approach are used by people that I consider some of the best in the industry, and as such I’ve tried to learn from the best ideas I’ve come across to make the most informed decisions possible when determining whether or not to schedule the next step (i.e., the phone interview).\n\nIf you’re involved in creating things for the web, take heed to my suggestions. Even if you don’t follow all of them, definitely make it a point to raise the quality of your résumé.\n"},

        "html":"\u003cp\u003eIn July 2006, I co-founded a startup along with three of the smartest guys I’ve ever met. Four and a half years later, the company has just recently launched something that I’d consider \u003cem\u003epre-alpha\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’m no longer with the company, I truly wish the remaining team the absolute best. We had some groundbreaking and innovative ideas, and I hope that a real, viable product will emerge soon. Thomas Edison — inventor of the lightbulb — once said “I’ve never failed. I’ve simply found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” Up until today, WarpShare has been — by nearly all definitions — a business failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn’t mean that it will continue to be a business failure, only that the team hasn’t yet gotten to where we/they need to be, even after four-\u003cem\u003esomeodd\u003c/em\u003e years. Starting and running an early-stage company has been simultaneously the greatest and worst experience of my entire life, besides raising my children, of course. Here are some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-business-plan-doesnt-matter\"\u003eYour business plan doesn’t matter.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t. At all. It doesn’t matter because it’s all going to change. Tomorrow you’ll realize that somebody else is doing a better version of your idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, you might realize that this teeny-tiny idea you have is actually much bigger than you’d originally thought, and you’ll need to adjust everything to take the modified idea into account. Perhaps you expect it to change. Perhaps you know it’s not perfect. Great, because at least your either honest or smart enough to know that. Having a business plan written down isn’t bad; just make sure that you treat it as a rough draft at all times. It’s not final, and it never will be. If it is final, then you’re either the very smartest or very dumbest entrepreneur in the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re planning to go for a venture capital (“VC”) round, know that VCs don’t care about the plan — they care about your team. Rather, they need to believe in your team’s ability to execute a great idea. If you don’t believe in either your team or the idea, VCs will sniff that out and you’ll get nowhere with them. If a VC firm has never heard of you before, you’re less likely to get funded. That’s the long and the short of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"choose-your-business-partners-like-you-would-choose-your-spouse\"\u003eChoose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just \u003cem\u003eroll over\u003c/em\u003e. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-good-investor-meeting-means-nothing-if-they-dont-write-a-check\"\u003eA good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dont-get-starry-eyes-just-yet\"\u003eDon’t get starry eyes just yet.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or \u003cem\u003e[insert awe-inspiring startup here]\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months. She was a loan officer for Washington Mutual Bank and was suddenly having a tough time closing deals (Washington Mutual ended up \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110407201511/https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Washington_Mutual#Rise_and_fall\"\u003egetting eaten alive during the real estate crash, and its assets were handed over to J.P. Morgan Chase\u003c/a\u003e). Since our startup was \u003cem\u003esure\u003c/em\u003e to be wildly successful in the next few months, she decided to go back to school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead the opposite happened. The housing market tanked and took the investment community down with it. Thousands of companies started shedding employees by the ton. My wife was laid-off and pretty much all of our investment deals fell through — all at the same time. It was the perfect storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went from making $150,000 a year to having no income at all, within only a few months. We liquidated all of our assets and maxed out all of our credit cards to try and stay afloat just a little longer. “We did have that good investor meeting, after all. Maybe they’ll write us a check next week.” While work ethic, determination and perseverance are valuable traits for a startup founder, starry eyes will only deceive you. If you’re successful, you could end up being an accidental billionaire. If not, you could end up being financially ruined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"it-will-take-a-toll-on-your-family\"\u003eIt will take a toll on your family.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we started out with four co-founders, one of them was only there to help us get started and offer his network of connections to us. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in the end, there were three of us who were fully invested in making this thing go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say that startup founders experience really high “highs” and really low “lows.” This is the truest statement I’ve ever heard with regard to startup life. But when you found a new startup immediately before the whole country goes into a massive recession, you encounter far more lows than you do highs. Of the three of us, two of us ended up \u003cem\u003edivorced\u003c/em\u003e. The one who didn’t was the bachelor of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I’m not saying that every startup founder will go through this, and in our cases the startup was not the only factor in the equation, but it will definitely take a toll on you and your family. Plan on it. While I was going through a complete financial, marital and business meltdown in 2008, I would occasionally tweet obscure references to how I was feeling and what I was going through. I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"shipping-is-your-most-valuable-feature\"\u003eShipping is your most valuable feature.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. \u003cem\u003eIf you don’t ship, you have nothing.\u003c/em\u003e Let me say that again: \u003cem\u003eIf you don’t ship, you have nothing.\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110407201511/http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/04/20/10.html\"\u003eRands once said\u003c/a\u003e “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGotten together your initial team.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBurned through some cash.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDone a ton of planning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDone a ton of coding.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArgued with your team about the right thing to build.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA ton of other stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product.

I’d taken on another daytime job to pay the bills. All-in-all, we burned a lot of time and a lot of cash just trying to figure out what the heck we were going to do. All along the way, we’d been trying to get VC funding so that we could feed our families and hire some people to help us make progress in narrowing our focus so that we could build something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, none of the VCs had ever heard of us before, and we didn’t have a product to show them yet. Finally, in May 2009 we restarted development in earnest.

In our case, we didn’t have the resources to build something awesome for users, so we tried to build for VCs to get the money to build for our users.

If you don’t have something working that you can show them, don’t even bother setting up the meeting. Realistically, you need a working demo to pitch to angel investors. You need a live product with real users to pitch to VCs.

        "plain":"In July 2006, I co-founded a startup along with three of the smartest guys I’ve ever met. Four and a half years later, the company has just recently launched something that I’d consider pre-alpha.\nAlthough I’m no longer with the company, I truly wish the remaining team the absolute best. We had some groundbreaking and innovative ideas, and I hope that a real, viable product will emerge soon. Thomas Edison — inventor of the lightbulb — once said “I’ve never failed. I’ve simply found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” Up until today, WarpShare has been — by nearly all definitions — a business failure.\nThat doesn’t mean that it will continue to be a business failure, only that the team hasn’t yet gotten to where we/they need to be, even after four-someodd years. Starting and running an early-stage company has been simultaneously the greatest and worst experience of my entire life, besides raising my children, of course. Here are some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.\nYour business plan doesn’t matter. It doesn’t. At all. It doesn’t matter because it’s all going to change. Tomorrow you’ll realize that somebody else is doing a better version of your idea.\nOn the other hand, you might realize that this teeny-tiny idea you have is actually much bigger than you’d originally thought, and you’ll need to adjust everything to take the modified idea into account. Perhaps you expect it to change. Perhaps you know it’s not perfect. Great, because at least your either honest or smart enough to know that. Having a business plan written down isn’t bad; just make sure that you treat it as a rough draft at all times. It’s not final, and it never will be. If it is final, then you’re either the very smartest or very dumbest entrepreneur in the entire world.\nIf you’re planning to go for a venture capital (“VC”) round, know that VCs don’t care about the plan — they care about your team. Rather, they need to believe in your team’s ability to execute a great idea. If you don’t believe in either your team or the idea, VCs will sniff that out and you’ll get nowhere with them. If a VC firm has never heard of you before, you’re less likely to get funded. That’s the long and the short of it.\nIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\nChoose your business partners like you would choose your spouse. You wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\nFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\nSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\nFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\n  We had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\n  We were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\n  We were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just roll over. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\n  We all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\n  A good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check. During the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\nTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\nDon’t get starry eyes just yet. “This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or [insert awe-inspiring startup here].\nMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months. She was a loan officer for Washington Mutual Bank and was suddenly having a tough time closing deals (Washington Mutual ended up getting eaten alive during the real estate crash, and its assets were handed over to J.P. Morgan Chase). Since our startup was sure to be wildly successful in the next few months, she decided to go back to school.\nInstead the opposite happened. The housing market tanked and took the investment community down with it. Thousands of companies started shedding employees by the ton. My wife was laid-off and pretty much all of our investment deals fell through — all at the same time. It was the perfect storm.\nWe went from making $150,000 a year to having no income at all, within only a few months. We liquidated all of our assets and maxed out all of our credit cards to try and stay afloat just a little longer. “We did have that good investor meeting, after all. Maybe they’ll write us a check next week.” While work ethic, determination and perseverance are valuable traits for a startup founder, starry eyes will only deceive you. If you’re successful, you could end up being an accidental billionaire. If not, you could end up being financially ruined.\nIt will take a toll on your family. While we started out with four co-founders, one of them was only there to help us get started and offer his network of connections to us. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in the end, there were three of us who were fully invested in making this thing go.\nThey say that startup founders experience really high “highs” and really low “lows.” This is the truest statement I’ve ever heard with regard to startup life. But when you found a new startup immediately before the whole country goes into a massive recession, you encounter far more lows than you do highs. Of the three of us, two of us ended up divorced. The one who didn’t was the bachelor of the group.\nNow, I’m not saying that every startup founder will go through this, and in our cases the startup was not the only factor in the equation, but it will definitely take a toll on you and your family. Plan on it. While I was going through a complete financial, marital and business meltdown in 2008, I would occasionally tweet obscure references to how I was feeling and what I was going through. I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\nShipping is your most valuable feature. It doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Let me say that again: If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Rands once said “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\n Gotten together your initial team. Burned through some cash. Done a ton of planning. Done a ton of coding. Argued with your team about the right thing to build. A ton of other stuff.  You want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\nSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product. Once we figured out what the product would be, we tried to figure out what it looked like, how it would work, etc.\nBy this point, we were long-since out of cash. I’d taken on another daytime job to pay the bills. All-in-all, we burned a lot of time and a lot of cash just trying to figure out what the heck we were going to do.

Over the next 10 months until I left to join Amazon Web Services, we were able to accomplish a lot considering how abysmally resource-constrained we were. The next time around, I plan to do a few things very differently.\n  I won’t quit my daytime job until I believe that the idea is going to go somewhere.\n  Focus on building the minimum viable product.

While my own experience as a startup founder has thus far led to a business that hasn’t yet succeeded, it doesn’t mean that yours will end up the same way.

Plan on it. While I was going through a complete financial, marital and business meltdown in 2008, I would occasionally tweet obscure references to how I was feeling and what I was going through. I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\n\n## Shipping is your most valuable feature.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. *If you don’t ship, you have nothing.* Let me say that again: *If you don’t ship, you have nothing.* [Rands once said]({{% wayback \"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/04/20/10.html\" %}}) “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\n\n1. Gotten together your initial team.\n2. Burned through some cash.\n3. Done a ton of planning.\n4. Done a ton of coding.\n5. Argued with your team about the right thing to build.\n6. A ton of other stuff.\n\nYou want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\n\nSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product. Once we figured out what the product would be, we tried to figure out what it looked like, how it would work, etc.\n\nBy this point, we were long-since out of cash. I’d taken on another daytime job to pay the bills. All-in-all, we burned a lot of time and a lot of cash just trying to figure out what the heck we were going to do. All along the way, we’d been trying to get VC funding so that we could feed our families and hire some people to help us make progress in narrowing our focus so that we could build something.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the VCs had ever heard of us before, and we didn’t have a product to show them yet. Finally, in May 2009 we restarted development in earnest. Over the next 10 months until I left to join Amazon Web Services, we were able to accomplish a lot considering how abysmally resource-constrained we were. The next time around, I plan to do a few things very differently.\n\n1. I won’t quit my daytime job until I believe that the idea is going to go somewhere.\n\n2. Focus on building the minimum viable product. In our case, we had to significantly narrow our scope so that we could figure out what to build first. We were all so excited about the future that we couldn’t figure out where to start.\n\n3. Your customers are not venture capitalists, so don’t make the mistake of trying to build something that you think VCs will fund. Instead, build something that *users will love*. VC money will follow the users. In our case, we didn’t have the resources to build something awesome for users, so we tried to build for VCs to get the money to build for our users. This strategy never worked for us, not even once, and in retrospect it was one of the **worst** ideas we ever had.\n\n4. Demo, don’t pitch. Again, VCs don’t care about pitches. If you’ve never done a successful startup before, then they’re not going to fund you anyway. If you don’t have something working that you can show them, don’t even bother setting up the meeting. Realistically, you need a working demo to pitch to angel investors. You need a live product with real users to pitch to VCs. If all that you show up with is a tie and a piece of paper talking about what your business plan is, you’ve just wasted the time of everybody in the room — including your own.\n\n## Perseverance is paramount.\n\nOnce you go all-in on your startup, you need to be truly all-in. If you want to succeed, you need to treat this project like a life-or-death situation. You need to believe that you will live or die by the success of what you’re working on. If you hedge your bet and leave yourself an out, you won’t make it. Paul Graham, a VC from YCombinator, [once said]({{% wayback \"http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they’ve become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that’s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can’t pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server. Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!\n\nThis is the one piece of advice that got me through so many of those dark, demoralizing days. Just keep typing.\n\n## Conclusion.\n\nWhile my own experience as a startup founder has thus far led to a business that hasn’t yet succeeded, it doesn’t mean that yours will end up the same way. Whether you’re trying to do an Internet startup like me, or simply trying to start a consulting business out of your home, all of the aforementioned points apply.\n\n1. Your business plan doesn’t matter. Doing something is what matters.\n\n2. Choose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\n\n3. If you’re looking for funding, only the check matters.\n\n4. Focus on what you can do here and now — not at some arbitrary point in the future.\n\n5. It can take a toll on your family. Families can’t go on autopilot. Take time away from work to spend with the people you love.\n\n6. If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Or (if you’re providing a service instead of a product) if you’re not currently providing the service, you have nothing.\n\n7. The only person who can make this thing go is you. It will be hard. It will be frustrating. Make it go anyway.\n\nFinally, while this is by no means an exhaustive list, I would recommend spending some quality time digesting the writing from the following authors:\n\n* [Paul Graham]({{% wayback \"http://paulgraham.com/articles.html\" %}})\n* [Michael Lopp (aka “Rands”)]({{% wayback \"http://randsinrepose.com\" %}})\n* [Seth Godin]({{% wayback \"http://sethgodin.typepad.com\" %}})\n* [John Maeda]({{% wayback \"http://lawsofsimplicity.com\" %}})\n\n"},

Here’s the problem: In the high-bandwidth digital world that we currently live in, distribution costs are next-to-zero. However, in the archaic world that Big Media lives in, whoever solves the \\[physical\\] distribution problem makes the most money. The problem is that distribution is no longer a problem (now that we’re in the digital age), and Big Media is still trying to solve it. (See [Sony’s DRM-Free Gift Cards]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/07/sony-bmg-skips-drm-for-platinum-musicpass-mp3-gift-cards/\" %}}).)\n\n2. **iTunes Hi-Definition Movie Rentals are only for Apple TV, not for computers.** — You’ve got a 20-inch monitor and a 640x480 resolution movie playing. Seriously? Why? Oh, because Big Media wants to charge a premium for HD content, and if it ends up on a fully-functional computer then the DRM might get broken, and they would lose control of the content. Nevermind that I’m watching a tiny video on a giant monitor/TV/whatever. And nevermind that I don’t have an Apple TV.\n\n3. **HD content is available to rent, not to buy.** — You can rent HD content on your Apple TV, but you absolutely can’t buy it. Why? Because Big Media wants to get people to drive down to their local Walmart store and purchase a physical box with a physical HD-DVD or Blu-ray formatted disc in it. Oh wait, you have a Playstation 3 so you want watch Blu-ray movies, but [Bourne Ultimatum]({{% wayback \"http://www.amazon.com/Bourne-Ultimatum-Combo-DVD-Standard/dp/B000VWYJ8Q/\" %}}) is only available in HD in HD-DVD format. I guess I’ll need to spend another $300 for an HD-DVD player as well.\n\nNow, for a consumer who owns an Apple TV, the fact that they can rent movies directly from their TV without having to drive to the video store is pretty handy. For the rest of us that are more digital media savvy, it is absolutely amazing to me that Big Media is so out of touch with their customers that they would do this to them. Now, let’s look at the reality:\n\n1. **Having two competing HD formats is bad for consumers.** — Lots of people have either Playstations, Xbox 360s, Tivo HDs, and relatively modern computers. Why are we wasting shelf space with physical discs where some movies are in one format and other movies are in another format. Digital 720p/1080p movies should be Big Media’s biggest push right now, and it’s not. Lost money, right there, lying on the floor.\n\n2. **Having insane DRM restrictions hurts consumers.** — Why waste the time with heavily DRM-laden content, when I can just get DRM-free HD content from the darker places on the internet (the “DarkNets”)? After reading about how [this guy’s Netflix downloads wouldn’t play because of the monitor he was using]({{% wayback \"http://davisfreeberg.com/2008/01/03/bad-copp-no-netflix/\" %}}), you can bet I’ll never use the Netflix service, Amazon Unbox, or Windows Vista… EVER. I’ll just download content from the DarkNets because the currently-legal-yet-ridiculously-broken models for digital media suck for consumers.\n\n3. **The DRM used by the Blu-ray and HD-DVD formats has already been broken.** — It’s only a matter of time before more people buy HD-DVD and/or Blu-ray drives for their computers, crack the DRM on movies they rent, and post those consumer-friendly files on the internet. That business model (give away good stuff for free) is far more effective — and will ramp up faster — than either Blu-ray or HD-DVD will in the marketplace.\n\nNow, here’s my proposal: What if, instead of causing consumers grief with ridiculous restrictions on HD content, what if there was a way to monetize the flow of this content across the internet? Where money was made, not by restricting the content beyond belief, nor by forcing people to drive down to their local Walmart store and purchase a physical box with a physical disc, but by monetizing the free flow of the content. The more the content flows, and the more people who share HD movies over P2P, the more money is made. What would that world look like?\n\nConsumers would certainly be happier because they could get whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted it. Labels and Studios would be happy because they’d be making more money than ever before by embracing this new model. Everyone wins, right? All I’ll say is this: **WarpShare**. Keep your eyes and ears open folks. More information is coming soon. ;)\\\n\nOh, and for anyone keeping track of the current score, Piracy is beating Legal Solutions: 489,672,211,642 to 0.\n"},

With over 20 million users, MySpace has to be doing \u003cem\u003esomething\u003c/em\u003e right. Many movie and music websites are foregoing standard www.com websites in favor of myspace.com/whatever websites. This says a lot about the kind of draw that MySpace has! What MySpace sacrifices in terms of solid usability, reasonable uptime, good design, a web services API, and respect from the web standards crowd, they make up for with their network of people — especially for those under 35 or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a MySpace account because my best friend said “Hey, you should get a MySpace account.” That was enough to get me to sign up, but not enough to get me to stay. Why did I stay? Because I can find nearly everybody I’ve ever known in my life on MySpace. MySpace has allowed me to get back in touch with old friends from high school and otherwise that I haven’t talked to in years. People aren’t there to share interests… they’re there to share themselves with people they know. THAT’S the major differentiator! People gathering around interests with other strangers is one thing, people keeping up with their past and present friends is on another level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial bookmarking services like del.icio.us have been successful for two reasons. The first is that they solve the problem of keeping track of bookmarks across browsers and computers. Simple enough. The second is that del.icio.us makes it really, really easy to add bookmarks to their service. They’ve lowered the barriers to the point where it’s as easy to add a bookmark to del.icio.us as it is to add it to your browser. Lowering and/or eliminating barriers while solving a common frustration makes for a great service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther services are doing a good job too (I recently switched from del.icio.us to \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070328092136/http://ma.gnolia.com\"\u003eMa.gnolia\u003c/a\u003e for my social bookmarks) because I think they’re technically better, and it looks better as well. There are some really cool social features built in that make it a better choice. The only complaint I have with Ma.gnolia is that sometimes it feels like the design gets in the way. You don’t get that with del.icio.us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServices like Digg and Newsvine are really cool for a number of reasons. First of all, my time and attention are very important to me. I don’t want to have to read through all of the worthless posts just to try to find the gold nuggets of information scattered around. Social news sites like Digg and Newsvine are pre-filtered for me. They’ve already gone through a (fairly) rigorous screening process, and I only see topics (on the homepage) that the rest of the community thinks are worthwhile. Where I think Digg and Newsvine diverge is that technologists are a very passionate people, and Digg was built around technologists. Newsvine tends to be more general news, and you simply have less passionate users there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I’m not saying that people who are into politics and world news aren’t passionate, I’m just saying that technologists seem to be more passionate about their preferred topic, which is why Digg is the front runner and Newsvine is still coming along.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYouTube is far and away the front runner on the social video front. I can’t quite put my finger on why they took off as quickly as they did, other than they got a ton of buzz in two networks: MySpace and the Blogophere. YouTube videos are really easy to get into MySpace profiles and blog posts, in a video format that loads very quickly, and they used industry standard technologies (\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070328092136/http://adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\"\u003eFlash\u003c/a\u003e) rather than creating yet another format that people need to download a plugin for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that last point, they did the same thing that del.icio.us did… they lowered the barriers to the point where they simply didn’t exist by going with Flash Video. As a consumer, the only thing I have to do to get a YouTube video on my homepage or MySpace profile is to copy and paste a single line of code that I don’t even need to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic related services like Last.fm, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070328092136/http://mog.com\"\u003eMOG\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070328092136/http://mystrands.com\"\u003eMyStrands\u003c/a\u003e are doing something smart: They’ve all got plugins for the popular desktop music players (iTunes, Winamp, Windows Media Player, etc.). All I have to do is listen to my music in iTunes while I’m working or MySpacing, and that data gets uploaded to the aforementioned services. Those services take that data and calculate things like favorite artists, tags, music recommendations, and other music-related things. I think it’s really cool that I can be introduced to new music simply by listening to some of my favorite tracks while I’m working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, they’ve taken all of the work out of getting people to use it, making it more attractive than services where I have to invest more time and attention that I’m already in short supply of. Flickr isn’t the largest or most popular photo sharing service, but it’s certainly the best. Flickr is focused around sharing your photos, and — again — they’ve removed the barriers from sharing/viewing photos that many other less successful services still have in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends Ben and Jen share photos of their son with their \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070328092136/http://snapfish.com\"\u003eSnapfish\u003c/a\u003e account. Can I view those pictures easily? No. First, I have to give Snapfish my email address (no-no #1), and then I have to let them bombard me with with notices telling me to purchase prints for so many cents a print (no-no #2). If they had Flickr, they could simply send me a URL for the photoset via email, and I could look at the pictures. Simple. Easy. No problem. I haven’t seen pictures of their kid in over a year because I don’t trust Snapfish or Hewlett-Packard (the parent company).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070328092136/http://photobucket.com\"\u003ePhotobucket\u003c/a\u003e is (I believe) the largest photo sharing service on the internet at the moment. Why? The only reason Photobucket is #1 is because they did the best job riding the MySpace wave. The service isn’t all that great, I can’t do cool things with my photos because they have no API, and their first wave customer support is worthless. Photobucket is not a compelling service, and I don’t think they’ll be around for more than a couple more years. User-oriented services like Flickr will be around much, \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly is the Twitter phenomina. People either \u003cdel\u003elove\u003c/del\u003e are addicted to Twitter, or they hate Twitter. My friend Matt used Twitter for a day or two, and couldn’t stand it. I believe he said something along the lines of “I’d rather have someone mash fistfuls of sand into my eyeballs with a hammer than to use the Twitter UI again.” Me, on the other hand? I post a new status every few hours, and it’s an interesting way to see what other bloggers do/say/think when they’re not trying to compose a piece of writing for the whole world to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know whether to call Twitter “successful” or not — I think the jury’s still out on this one — but they’ve definitely got an active community growing, and that’s a valuable thing to have.
