Feel free to tune for security/convenience according to your tastes.\n  AWS Config File After adding credentials to aws-vault (e.g., aws-vault add default), you can instruct the aws-cli to use aws-vault instead of ~/.aws/credentials.\nHere is an ~/.aws/config entry for the default profile:\n[default] region=us-east-1 credential_process=aws-vault exec -j default After all credentials are stored in aws-vault, and all ~/.aws/config entries have been updated with the credential_process line, ~/.aws/credentials should be empty.\nViewing Credentials macOS ships with the FreeBSD flavor of command line tools instead of the GNU flavor which ships with most Linuxes. This post references the GNU flavor. Please see “Using GNU command line tools in macOS instead of FreeBSD tools” for more information.\n If you want to view the credentials for a profile, or if you want to expose them as environment variables, you can run:\naws-vault exec default -- env | grep --no-color ^AWS | sort If you want to use them, the aws-cli will pick up environment variables before it looks for a credentials definition. So, if you want to use aws-vault with aws-cli without specifying the credential_process setting in your ~/.aws/config entry, you can do something like this:\naws-vault exec default -- aws s3 ls Token Types The AWS CLI (and any other tools built on AWS SDKs) will leverage the AWS_SESSION_TOKEN and AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN values before leveraging the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values.\nAWS_SESSION_TOKEN and AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN tokens are more secure because they are ephemeral, and expire after a short (measured in hours) TTL. For this reason, these should generally be used instead of the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values.\n  But there is an exception — there are certain types of IAM-related tasks which cannot be performed using AWS_SESSION_TOKEN and AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN tokens, because they are IAM tokens themselves. In these cases, you want to fall back to the long-lived AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values. You can do this by passing the --no-session option to the aws-vault command.\naws-vault exec default --no-session -- env | grep --no-color ^AWS | sort Here, you can see that the AWS_SESSION_TOKEN and AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN tokens are not generated, so the AWS CLI (and any other tools built on AWS SDKs) will leverage the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY values instead.\nPassing to (local) Docker It is becoming more popular to provide Docker containers for running software, especially when that software has a number of (potentially-complex) dependencies.
