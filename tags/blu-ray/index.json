You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"f5IcBtaMR_k\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube. It was alright — if a bit gimmicky — but all was well in those days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wtf-wii\"\u003eWTF Wii?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that you sold a bajillion of them, and that was the beginning of your problems. You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/super-mario-galaxy.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMetroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Smash Bros.

Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wii-u\"\u003eWii U\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"4e3qaPg_keg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whats-next-with-the-nx\"\u003eWhat’s next with the NX?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/nx.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"nintendo-account\"\u003eNintendo Account\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, figure out how to run a \u003cem\u003efreaking\u003c/em\u003e Nintendo account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of us live international lives.

I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/retro-fighters.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGive us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware.

It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sure that \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905133840/http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\"\u003eSuper Mario 3D World\u003c/a\u003e doesn’t require as much processing power as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905133840/https://www.callofduty.com/advancedwarfare\"\u003eCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u003c/a\u003e, so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant.

Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK).

I have invested so much time and energy into your products over the years that I feel a certain qualification to be able to talk about them as an expert-level consumer.\nThis was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n Let’s go back to the GameCube With the GameCube, you very nearly achieved perfection. You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  It also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube. It was alright — if a bit gimmicky — but all was well in those days.\nWTF Wii? I know that you sold a bajillion of them, and that was the beginning of your problems. You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\nYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\n  You also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\nSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\nLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\n Super Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2) Mario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.) Metroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.) Super Smash Bros. Brawl Super Paper Mario New Super Mario Bros. …and Donkey Kong Returns was pretty good.  8 good games on that console and everything else was crap. Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\nWii U Wii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  Also, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\nInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\nThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\nWhat’s next with the NX?   Nintendo Account Still, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\nFirst, figure out how to run a freaking Nintendo account.\n  I should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\n  I should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\n  Some of us live international lives. Allow me to log onto my child’s Canadian console using my U.S. account, so that I can continue using my game data (etc.) while spending time with my children in another country.\n  There should not be separate balances for the Wii U store vs. the 3DS store. This is ridiculous. They should be the same store, the same account, the same money. I login, buy stuff, and play.\n  Lastly, I should be able to throw my console in the ocean, buy a new one, log-in, and be able to re-download all of my games and settings.\n  Microsoft has this figured out. Apple has this figured out. Sony has this (sorta) figured out. Why haven’t you been able to figure this out yet?\nNormal Controllers Please, for the love of god, stop making controllers “unique”. I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\n  Give us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware. Save that for games and gameplay, not hardware.\nFigure out the first vs. third-party game situation Nintendo hardware has been running a generation behind ever since the Wii was released in 2006. It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\nI’m sure that Super Mario 3D World doesn’t require as much processing power as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\nYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\nNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant. You make the best games for your own console. But — there are a few things to think about, because you’ve been sending mixed signals for a long time now.\n  If you want to focus on making first-party games on Nintendo consoles, that’s great. But you need to actually focus on making first-party games. You didn’t do this for the first half of the Wii U’s existence.\n  If you don’t want to put much effort into third-party games, that’s cool too — but say so. Stop allowing so much crapware to be sold for Nintendo consoles. But also remember that if the best third-party games are on a Sony or Microsoft console, and customers have a limited budget, who’s console are they going to buy?\n  If you want to enable and support third-party developers, great! Then do it! Provide them support, help them to deliver the best possible gaming experiences, and ship hardware that is as powerful as the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.\n  Embrace Digital Downloads Digital downloads are the now, not just the future. Build out a world-class online store that can be accessed from TV consoles, handheld consoles, and computer Internet users alike. Focus on making downloads both fast and plentiful. Ship fewer and fewer games on disc, and instead ship larger hard drives that support expansion through external disks.\nEmbrace broadband, hard drives, digital downloads, and a world-class online store. You implemented the kids’ version of those things in the Wii U. Now build a modern version for grown-ups.\nPay Attention to your Competition Aside from Nintendo, Apple is the only other company with small-screen (e.g., iOS) and large screen (e.g., macOS, tvOS) gaming platforms. Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK). They have way more users than Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony combined. They have powerful developer frameworks that enable game developers to build bigger, better, faster worlds.\nThe new Apple TV is squarely in your turf. No, they may not have their own Marios or Zeldas or Samuses, but their platform has enabled the likes of Lili, Oceanhorn, and The Legend of Skyfish. They may not (yet) have the rich history of Nintendo’s characters, but it’s only a matter of time.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  Right now, Apple is focused on TV. And that’s probably good for you. But what happens when they ship an Apple TV “Pro” focused on gaming? They have an excellent SDK, an excellent games platform, the MFi Controller program, rock-solid account management, extremely fast game (i.e., “app”) downloads, and a dearth of end-users with limited funds for new game consoles?\nSee the follow-up, “Dear Nintendo, Part II”\n ",

You can throw all sorts of stuff inside this container, so people like to stash it full of subtitle files and other sorts of things. **AC3** is the name of the *Dolby Digital* surround-sound audio format. You typically need a dedicated decoder ship to handle this kind of audio, which is common in modern receivers and some TVs.\n\n\n## MKV → MP4\n\nThe first thing we need to do download a copy of [MP4Tools]({{% wayback \"http://www.emmgunn.com/mp4tools/mp4toolshome.html\" %}}).\n\nWhile you can use it without a license, it’s always a good idea to support the independent software developers who write this stuff — especially if its useful.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/mp4tools-default.png\"\u003e}}\n\nWhen you drag your MKV file into MP4Tools, you should see two entries — the video stream and the audio stream.\n\nThe video stream should already be in **H.264** format. (If it isn’t, stop what you’re doing and run the file through [Handbrake]({{% wayback \"http://handbrake.fr\" %}}) instead.) Check the box next to the stream to select it.\n\nIf the audio stream is already in **AAC** format, this will be very simple. If the audio stream is in **AC3** format, this will still be simple, but will take a little longer to complete.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/mp4tools-working.png\"\u003e}}\n\n1. For **H.264** video, choose *Pass Thru*.\n\n2. For **AAC** audio (if available), choose *Pass Thru*.\n\n3. For **AC3** audio (if available), choose the highest AAC audio selection you have available (either *AAC (2-Ch.)* or *AAC (5.1)*). If you selected *AAC (5.1)*, also check the box for *add 2-Ch. Track*.\n\nLastly, choose your intended device. The *Apple TV* setting tends to have the broadest compatibility in my experience. Leave everything else as the default setting, and click the *Convert* button.\n\nIn a few minutes, you should have a new `.m4v` file.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/m4v.png\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Metadata and Artwork\n\nIt’s possible that you may have heard of *AtomicParsley*, *MetaX* or *MetaZ* before. They all suck. Check out [Subler]({{% wayback \"http://code.google.com/p/subler/\" %}}) instead.\n\nOnce you have your `.m4v` file, you’ll want to add the metadata and artwork to the file. As long as the video file starts with a format similar to `\u003cshow\u003e.s\u003c#\u003ee\u003c#\u003e` (e.g., `Weeds.s7e1`), Subler will be able to determine the right things to search for.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/subler-metadata.png\"\u003e}}\n\nSubler queries [TVDB]({{% wayback \"http://thetvdb.com\" %}}) for TV show data, although I’m generally unimpressed with the TV show artwork. For that, I use [Get Video Artwork]({{% wayback \"http://getvideoartwork.com\" %}}) and download the iTunes-compatible, square-shaped TV show artwork.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/subler-artwork.png\"\u003e}}\n\nWhile Subler does a good job of checking the right boxes automatically, you’ll want to check the *Other Settings* and make sure that the resolution and media kind are set correctly for your new `.m4v` file.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/subler-other.png\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Renaming\n\nI prefer to keep my video files sorted by `\u003cshow\u003e/\u003cseason\u003e/\u003cfile\u003e`. I also go so far to name my files as `S.E - Title.mp4` (e.g., a recent episode of *Supernatural* was labeled *8.15 - Man’s Best Friend with Benefits*).\n\nGoing episode-by-episode can be very tedious, so I wrote up a [Mac OS X service]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/rename-workflow.zip\" %}}) to handle this for me. The only prerequisite is to install a package called [mp4v2]({{% wayback \"https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/multimedia/mp4v2/Portfile\" %}}) from [MacPorts]({{% wayback \"http://macports.org\" %}}).\n\n```bash\nsudo port install mp4v2\n```\n\nOnce you’ve installed MacPorts (if you hadn’t already) and the **mp4v2** package, you can install the OS X service by double-clicking it. (It’s an Automator action, so feel free to take a look at what it does before installing it.)\n\nWith everything installed, you can now right-click on one or more video files, choose *Services*, then “Rename video to 1.01 - Title.mp4”.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/workflow.png\"\u003e}}\n\nWithin a few seconds, the Automator workflow will read the contents of the video file for the season number, episode number, and episode title, and rename the file automatically.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/done.png\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Streaming from iTunes\n\nI’ve already covered this in my [previous post](/2013/04/08/converting-blu-ray-and-dvd-movies-to-mp4-using-mac-os-x-for-playback-on-ipad-apple-tv-playstation-3-xbox-360-roku-and-other-players/), so I’m not going to go over it again here.\n\nOnce it’s in iTunes, you can sync shows to your smartphone, iPad, or stream them to a variety of devices throughout your home.\n"},

        "plain":"I often find myself wanting to watch my movies when I’m on-the-go, or sitting at work writing code. I also have one Blu-ray player in the house, and hate having to sit through one unskippable warning or commercial after another.   Because of this, I choose to exercise my fair-use right to format-shift my movies into something more convenient. Making a personal backup of movies you own is in a legal gray-area in the U.S. Historically, this sort of thing fell under fair use law, but the DMCA (1998) makes it illegal to crack the encryption. This is why backing-up CDs is commonplace while backing-up DVDs and Blu-rays is frowned upon. The encryption is where the line is drawn. You’ve been warned!\nHardware The Mac used for this tutorial is an 17\u0026rdquo; MacBook Pro (early–2011) with a 64-bit quad-core 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, OS X Mountain Lion, and a standard, built-in Superdrive. The external BD-R drive is a Buffalo MediaStation 6X USB 2.0 Portable Blu-Ray Writer.\nBacking-up your discs Pretty much every Mac since the early 2000s has shipped with a DVD drive, so these are easy to come by. For backing up personal DVDs so that they can be format-shifted, RipIt is highly recommended. A license is a paltry $25, and I recommend supporting the developers of this software. Backing up is as simple as inserting the DVD, launching RipIt, and choosing “Rip”. You can expect a rip to take 15–30 minutes, depending on the size of the disc.\n  For Blu-ray discs, you first need a Blu-ray drive. For backing up personal Blu-rays so that they can be format-shifted, MakeMKV is highly recommended. We won’t be making .mkv files, but it has support for backups. A license is somewhere in the $60-$80 range, and I recommend supporting the developers of this software. Backing up is as simple as inserting the Blu-ray disc, launching MakeMKV, and choosing “Backup”. You can expect a rip to take 45m–1h15m, depending on the size of the disc.\n  If you’re on Windows, check-out AnyDVD and AnyDVD HD.\nFormat-Shifting to MP4/H.264/AAC Video files are a lot more complicated than most people realize. You may have heard words like MKV, MPEG–4, AVI, MP3, AAC and other acronyms.\nThe short explanation is that every video file is made up of 3 different parts: the video stream, the audio stream, and the container. The audio and video are synced-up (a.k.a., “multiplexed” or “muxed”) and are bundled together into a single file using a container format.\nIf you want to make yourself a little more educated about this stuff, check out the \u0026ldquo;Video on the Web\u0026rdquo; chapter of Dive Into HTML5 by Mark Pilgrim. For this exercise, just know that we want to end up with an H.264 video stream and an AAC audio stream, wrapped up inside an MP4 container.\nFor this, we’ll use Handbrake. Handbrake will take our personal backups as input, and produce an .mp4 (or .m4v — same thing) file as output.\nHandbrake comes with a good set of default settings. If you don’t know what you’re doing, feel free to use those. I’ve tweaked my settings a bit as I prefer higher-quality files at the cost of a larger file size.\nSee the following screenshots for information on my presets.\n  DVD: Video, Audio, Subtitles, Advanced, and Chapters.\n  Blu-ray: Video, Audio, Subtitles, Advanced, and Chapters.\n  The biggest difference between these is that the video bitrate for DVDs is 3,000 kbps while for Blu-rays it’s 10,000 kbps.\nTo get started, click the Source button in the upper-left corner of the main Handbrake window. Find your backup directory, and choose Open. Handbrake will parse the files and make sure it has a complete backup to work with. If you’re using my presets, choose DVD (480p) if your source is a DVD backup, or Blu-ray (1080p) if your source is a Blu-ray backup. It may also be helpful to check out the Handbrake Quick-Start Guide if you’re new to the tool.\n  Next, click the Add to Queue button. Once you’ve queued-up all of the movies you want to format-shift, click the Start button. On the reference hardware listed above, DVDs typically take 45m–1h30m to fully encode a new MP4 file. Blu-rays take 4–6 hours. In both cases, Handbrake will leverage as much of your CPU and RAM as possible, so don’t expect to be able to do much with your computer until its done.\nWith these settings, expect a 480p MP4 to be around 1 GB/hour of video and a 1080p MP4 to be around 5 GB/hour of video. If having a 15 GB copy of Titanic is too much, lower the video bitrate for the Blu-ray (1080p) setting from 10,000 kbps. The lower the setting, the worse the quality, but the smaller the file size.\n  One more tip: 1080p video has a resolution of 1920×1080. The smaller the screen, the less there is for your eyes to notice, so you can be more forgiving of lower-quality. However, if you’re stretching 1920×1080 across your nice new 55\u0026rdquo; LED TV, a low-quality file will make your whole movie-watching experience suck. The bigger the TV, the better you want the quality to be.\nMetadata and Artwork Once you have your .mp4 or .m4v file, you’ll want to give it a proper name and add the metadata and artwork to the file. The format I use is \u0026lt;name of movie\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;format\u0026gt;).mp4 (e.g., My Favorite Movie (1080p).mp4).\nIt’s possible that you may have heard of AtomicParsley, MetaX or MetaZ before. They all suck. Check out Subler instead.\n  Subler queries The Movie DB for movie data and artwork, and uses TVDB for TV show data. While The Movie DB has a pretty awesome selection of movie artwork, I’m generally unimpressed with the TV show artwork. For that, I use Get Video Artwork and download the iTunes-compatible, square-shaped TV show artwork.\n  Save your changes, and Subler will write the video metadata and artwork into the file.\nStreaming via iTunes I have an Xbox 360, a Playstation 3, and two Apple TVs at home. I also have an iPad 2, iPad 3 and an iPad mini. Needless to say, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows.\nBecause the video files tend to be so large, I use an external hard drive attached to my Mac to store the video files. I then tell iTunes where to find the movie by option-dragging the MP4 file from Finder into iTunes’ Movie pane. The option-drag tells iTunes “here’s a pointer to the movie, but don’t copy it onto my built-in hard drive”.\n  Now it’s time to watch your movie!\n  As of iOS 5, iPad supports 1080p video. Simply sync the movie to your iPad and watch it on-the-go.\n  As long as your computer running iTunes and your Apple TV are on the same network and are both configured to use the same Home Sharing account, you should be able to start streaming the movie to your Apple TV right away. (I would always recommend a hard-wired network connection, otherwise a Wireless-N connection. A Wireless-G connection is likely going to require more buffering or have choppy playback.)\n  To stream to your Playstation 3, you’ll need to be running a DLNA server on your Mac. Medialink ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Playstation 3.\n  To stream to your Xbox 360, you’ll need to be running a similar server which the Xbox understands. Connect360 ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Xbox 360.\n  Since MP4/H.264/AAC is the industry-wide standard for all modern-age video, pretty much any smartphone, tablet, laptop, operating system, and streaming device created since 2004 can play this format out-of-the-box. Even ancient OS’s like Windows XP have been updated to support this format. Go nuts.\n  ",

You can expect a rip to take 45m–1h15m, depending on the size of the disc.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-makemkv.png\"\u003e}}\n\nIf you’re on Windows, check-out [AnyDVD]({{% wayback \"http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvd.html\" %}}) and [AnyDVD HD]({{% wayback \"http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvdhd.html\" %}}).\n\n\n## Format-Shifting to MP4/H.264/AAC\n\nVideo files are a lot more complicated than most people realize. You may have heard words like MKV, MPEG–4, AVI, MP3, AAC and other acronyms.\n\nThe short explanation is that every video file is made up of **3 different parts**: the **video stream**, the **audio stream**, and the **container**. The audio and video are synced-up (a.k.a., “multiplexed” or “muxed”) and are bundled together into a single file using a container format.\n\nIf you want to make yourself a little more educated about this stuff, check out the \"[Video on the Web]({{% wayback \"http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html\" %}})\" chapter of *Dive Into HTML5* by Mark Pilgrim. For this exercise, just know that we want to end up with an **H.264** video stream and an **AAC** audio stream, wrapped up inside an **MP4** container.\n\nFor this, we’ll use [Handbrake]({{% wayback \"http://handbrake.fr\" %}}). Handbrake will take our personal backups as input, and produce an `.mp4` (or `.m4v` — same thing) file as output.\n\nHandbrake comes with a good set of default settings. If you don’t know what you’re doing, feel free to use those. I’ve tweaked my settings a bit as I prefer higher-quality files at the cost of a larger file size.\n\nSee the following screenshots for information on my presets.\n\n* **DVD:** [Video]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-video.png\" %}}), [Audio]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-audio.png\" %}}), [Subtitles]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-subtitles.png\" %}}), [Advanced]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-advanced.png\" %}}), and [Chapters]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-chapters.png\" %}}).\n\n* **Blu-ray:** [Video]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-video.png\" %}}), [Audio]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-audio.png\" %}}), [Subtitles]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-subtitles.png\" %}}), [Advanced]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-advanced.png\" %}}), and [Chapters]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-chapters.png\" %}}).\n\nThe biggest difference between these is that the video bitrate for DVDs is 3,000 kbps while for Blu-rays it’s 10,000 kbps.\n\nTo get started, click the *Source* button in the upper-left corner of the main Handbrake window. Find your backup directory, and choose *Open*. Handbrake will parse the files and make sure it has a complete backup to work with. If you’re using my presets, choose *DVD (480p)* if your source is a DVD backup, or *Blu-ray (1080p)* if your source is a Blu-ray backup. It may also be helpful to check out the [Handbrake Quick-Start Guide]({{% wayback \"https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/MacGuiGuide\" %}}) if you’re new to the tool.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/handbrake-source.png\"\u003e}}\n\nNext, click the *Add to Queue* button. Once you’ve queued-up all of the movies you want to format-shift, click the *Start* button. On the reference hardware listed above, DVDs typically take 45m–1h30m to fully encode a new MP4 file. Blu-rays take 4–6 hours. In both cases, Handbrake will leverage as much of your CPU and RAM as possible, so don’t expect to be able to do much with your computer until its done.\n\nWith these settings, expect a **480p** MP4 to be around **1 GB/hour** of video and a **1080p** MP4 to be around **5 GB/hour** of video. If having a 15 GB copy of *Titanic* is too much, lower the video bitrate for the *Blu-ray (1080p)* setting from 10,000 kbps. The lower the setting, the worse the quality, but the smaller the file size.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/titanic.png\"\u003e}}\n\n**One more tip:** 1080p video has a resolution of `1920×1080`. The smaller the screen, the less there is for your eyes to notice, so you can be more forgiving of lower-quality. However, if you’re stretching `1920×1080` across your nice new 55\" LED TV, a low-quality file will make your whole movie-watching experience suck. The bigger the TV, the better you want the quality to be.\n\n\n## Metadata and Artwork\n\nOnce you have your `.mp4` or `.m4v` file, you’ll want to give it a proper name and add the metadata and artwork to the file. The format I use is `\u003cname of movie\u003e (\u003cformat\u003e).mp4` (e.g., `My Favorite Movie (1080p).mp4`).\n\nIt’s possible that you may have heard of *AtomicParsley*, *MetaX* or *MetaZ* before. They all suck. Check out [Subler]({{% wayback \"http://code.google.com/p/subler/\" %}}) instead.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/subler-metadata.png\"\u003e}}\n\nSubler queries [The Movie DB]({{% wayback \"http://themoviedb.org\" %}}) for movie data and artwork, and uses [TVDB]({{% wayback \"http://thetvdb.com\" %}}) for TV show data. While The Movie DB has a pretty awesome selection of movie artwork, I’m generally unimpressed with the TV show artwork. For that, I use [Get Video Artwork]({{% wayback \"http://getvideoartwork.com\" %}}) and download the iTunes-compatible, square-shaped TV show artwork.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/subler-artwork.png\"\u003e}}\n\nSave your changes, and Subler will write the video metadata and artwork into the file.\n\n\n## Streaming via iTunes\n\nI have an Xbox 360, a Playstation 3, and two Apple TVs at home. I also have an iPad 2, iPad 3 and an iPad mini. Needless to say, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows.\n\nBecause the video files tend to be so large, I use an external hard drive attached to my Mac to store the video files. I then tell iTunes where to find the movie by *option-dragging* the MP4 file from Finder into iTunes’ *Movie* pane. The *option-drag* tells iTunes “here’s a pointer to the movie, but don’t copy it onto my built-in hard drive”.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/itunes.png\"\u003e}}\n\nNow it’s time to watch your movie!\n\n1. As of iOS 5, **iPad** supports 1080p video. Simply sync the movie to your iPad and watch it on-the-go.\n\n2. As long as your computer running iTunes and your **Apple TV** are on the same network and are both configured to use the same *Home Sharing* account, you should be able to start streaming the movie to your Apple TV right away. (I would always recommend a hard-wired network connection, otherwise a Wireless-N connection. A Wireless-G connection is likely going to require more buffering or have choppy playback.)\n\n3. To stream to your **Playstation 3**, you’ll need to be running a [DLNA]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance\" %}}) server on your Mac. [Medialink]({{% wayback \"http://www.nullriver.com/products/medialink\" %}}) ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Playstation 3.\n\n4. To stream to your **Xbox 360**, you’ll need to be running a similar server which the Xbox understands. [Connect360]({{% wayback \"http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360\" %}}) ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Xbox 360.\n\n5. Since MP4/H.264/AAC is the industry-wide *standard* for all modern-age video, pretty much any smartphone, tablet, laptop, operating system, and streaming device created since 2004 can play this format out-of-the-box. Even ancient OS’s like Windows XP have been updated to support this format. Go nuts.\n"},

H.264 did for video what MP3 did for music.\nCES 2013 and “4K” Ultra HDTV At the CES 2013 trade show this month, companies like Sony, Toshiba, Panasonic and others were showing-off prototypes of their new 70+ inch TVs that support a new resolution called 4K — otherwise known as the small version of Ultra HDTV). (Kinda like how 720p is the small version of HDTV.)\nThe approval of H.265 makes 4K television content possible. H.265 (or possibly the future H.266, depending on how long Blu-ray sticks around) will be the basis of whatever format replaces Blu-ray discs. DVD had a good 12-year run as the disc format du jour (1998–2010). Blu-ray debuted in 2006, so if we give it the same 12-year run as DVD had (circa 2018), Blu-ray has about 5 years left before its successor overtakes it in popularity.\n(As much as I would love to see Blu-ray be the final disc format, falling by the wayside in favor of all-digital streaming and downloads, I don’t think it’s going to happen just yet. The content industry needs something to sell and the average consumer needs something to buy. God forbid the general public is forced to figure out the epic clusterf**k known as UltraViolet DRM. But I digress…)\nHigher quality, smaller size For the forward-thinking folks who have already moved to all-digital, H.265 takes up half the drive space for the same quality file compared to H.264. All of my movies encoded with H.264 that take up 8–10 GB each, would only take 4–5 GB each. Alternatively, I can keep them at 8–10 GB each, and get resolutions of 3840x2160 (which would require a 4K TV to appreciate).\nThen again, if your TV is bigger than about 40–46 inches, 1080p starts to lose clarity as the pixels become more noticeable. A 55–60 inch 4K TV would be equivalent to your iPhones, iPads, and other devices with a Retina Display — pixels so small that you can’t see them unless you get really close. Of course, an 80-inch “8K” Ultra HDTV with matching H.265-encoded movies would be freaking epic! Goodbye IMAX, hello my living room!)\nThis also means that watching video on-the-go on your smartphone or iPad will be faster, the picture will be clearer, and video will eat-up less of your monthly data plan.\nWhat’s missing? There are still some important pieces missing from this equation — notably hardware decoders and video content.\nDecoding the video’s format into something that you can watch is a very intensive process. Doing the decoding in software requires much more processing power than decoding in hardware. Hardware decoding is what allows your iPhone, iPad or other device to play movies smoothly.\nContrast that with Android devices that support Flash. Animation and FLV playback tends to be stuttered, jarring, and chews through your battery because all of the decoding happens in software. Over the next 12–18 months, expect to start seeing H.265 decoders being shipped in new devices — especially mobile devices.\nThe other major piece of this equation is having H.265-encoded content. What’s the point of having all of this fancy H.265 hardware if there’s nothing to watch?\nThe first content will come from the hacker communities as Blu-ray movies encoded at 1080p with H.265 will start showing up on torrent sites. (These are what I call the super-alphas.) Over the next 3–5 years, the rest of the world will catch up as H.265 makes its way into the streaming content market (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes, Verizon, Comcast). Finally, H.265 will hit the mainstream in whatever disc format replaces Blu-ray — just a couple of years before H.265’s successor (presumably H.266) is approved, and the whole process starts over.\nNot that nerdy… no, really I said all of that to say this: H.265 may sound esoteric, but it unlocks a very bright future for video content (movies, TV shows, video games, web video, etc.) moving forward.\n",
