That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd follows that up with an important premise:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lastly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government.

No one wants to live in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support individual liberty, entrepreneurship, and open markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth is that free-market capitalism and universal social policies go well together — this isn\u0026rsquo;t about big government, it\u0026rsquo;s about smart government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a very good piece, and I hope you can take a few minutes to read it all. In the U.S., and especially among the Boomer generation, they hear \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and tend to equate it with Russian communism (which was actually never communism, but rather a dictator-style totalitarian socialism).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"too-much-capitalism-is-bad-for-you\"\u003eToo Much Capitalism Is Bad For You\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/predatory-capitalism.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ePhoto by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/5065175199/in/album-72157652056682098/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, I see the pros and cons of such a capitalistic-driven society. The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-a-better-america\"\u003eMaking A Better America\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ePhoto by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen \u003cem\u003edramatically\u003c/em\u003e since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I’m currently hearing from \u003cspan itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"\u003e\u003cspan itemprop=\"name\"\u003eTed Cruz\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n, \u003cspan itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"\u003e\u003cspan itemprop=\"name\"\u003eDonald Trump\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n, and \u003cspan itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"\u003e\u003cspan itemprop=\"name\"\u003eRand Paul\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right.

But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don\u0026rsquo;t like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they\u0026rsquo;re not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing.

What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you \u003cstrong\u003emust\u003c/strong\u003e vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate.

        "plain":"In response to “I moved to the US 7 years ago from Finland — here's what Americans don't understand about Nordic countries”, and why I support Bernie Sanders. This was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s what Americans don\u0026rsquo;t understand about Nordic countries Anu Partanen, writing for The Atlantic:\n Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Bernie Sanders ’ Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they\u0026rsquo;d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\nA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\nThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\n And follows that up with an important premise:\n But this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for me.\n And lastly,\n Americans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government. In fact, as a proud Finn, I often like to remind my American friends that my countrymen in Finland fought two brutal wars against the Soviet Union to preserve Finland\u0026rsquo;s freedom and independence against socialism. No one wants to live in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support individual liberty, entrepreneurship, and open markets.\nBut the truth is that free-market capitalism and universal social policies go well together — this isn\u0026rsquo;t about big government, it\u0026rsquo;s about smart government.\n This is a very good piece, and I hope you can take a few minutes to read it all. In the U.S., and especially among the Boomer generation, they hear \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and tend to equate it with Russian communism (which was actually never communism, but rather a dictator-style totalitarian socialism).\nToo Much Capitalism Is Bad For You  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/5065175199/in/album-72157652056682098/\n For me, I see the pros and cons of such a capitalistic-driven society. The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\nSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\nMaking A Better America  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\n I want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen dramatically since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\nWhat I’m currently hearing from Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , and Rand Paul is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again and including all Americans in that plan.\nUnfair?  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/22122675480/in/album-72157652056682098/\n Yes, a 60 year old couple with no kids paying more money in taxes so that some other couple can have their kids in better daycare sounds unfair at first. But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don\u0026rsquo;t like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they\u0026rsquo;re not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\nMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing. By raising-up the foundation for everyone, everybody benefits, albeit indirectly.\nSupport the Radical Center  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157652056682098/\n Lastly, I think our current 2-party system is the most toxic aspect of American politics. What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you must vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate. The Republican party has already assumed that Clinton will win the nomination on the Democratic side, but the race between herself and Sanders is extremely close. Conversely, the fact that loose cannons like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have made it as far as they have over more sane and level-headed candidates like Rand Paul and Marco Rubio is saddening.\nThe only way to break free of the 2-party system is to stop reinforcing this 2-party mentality. IMO, it’s toxic to the American people that the RNC and the DNC are private corporations who pay for broadcast airtime, and can change the rules to determine who can/cannot be part of the debates. This leads to Tweedism, and further separates the voters from the nomination process (in addition to super-delegates and the electoral college).\n Source: Lessig at MIT: \u0026#34;Tweedism\u0026#34;\nI would also love to see the entire population of the United States abstain from the next election until we could vote on meaningful campaign finance reform, but that will never happen.\nReform Ultimately, however, none of the promises made by presidential candidates will come to pass without substantial campaign finance reform. Congress decides on the budget, and it is the President’s job to spend that budget. With so many congresspeople in the pockets of large corporations instead of working in the best interests of the citizens they represent, there is little that will be accomplished until we achieve meaningful reform. With Ted Cruz taking money from the Oil \u0026amp; Coal industries, with Hillary Clinton taking money from Wall Street, and with Donald Trump taking money from the KKK, we’re all in big trouble.\nCitizen-funded elections is the only way to achieve this.\nP.S.

We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144532/https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality\"\u003eNet Neutrality\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strongly support \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth.

I’ve seen/heard how \u003ca href=\"https://instagram.com/byefelipe/\"\u003ewomen are treated in the dating scene\u003c/a\u003e and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the \u003cem\u003eReal Housewives of Wherever\u003c/em\u003e with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but \u003cem\u003eit’s just a nipple\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe war on drugs was a failure, so let\u0026rsquo;s move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t change anybody but yourself\u0026rdquo; is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026amp; 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u0026lt;5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the  education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144532/http://stemcells.nih.gov/research/scilit/highlights/pages/default.aspx\"\u003ehearing and sight recovery\u003c/a\u003e, as well as ALS (a.k.a., \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144532/http://www.webmd.com/brain/features/als-stem-cell-patient-trial\"\u003eLou Gehrig’s Disease\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanging jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote \u003cem\u003eagainst\u003c/em\u003e, instead of telling why they themselves are worth \u003cem\u003evoting for\u003c/em\u003e. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics.

I was taught that you had to vote Republican because otherwise the evil Democrats will win. And although they never actually said it, I was definitely taught that \u003cem\u003eJesus votes Republican\u003c/em\u003e. It wasn’t until my mid-20’s that I started seriously reviewing the issues, asking hard questions about them, and seeing where things still stood up vs. where they fell down. In the end, I realized that most things I’d been taught, politically, didn’t stand-up to scrutiny very well. I also wasn’t a strong supporter of most of what the Democratic party stood for either, so I find myself as an Independent — neither major party represents me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the direction that the Republican party has taken over the last 20 years, I find that they represent me less and less with each passing year. My own observations have shown me: More discrimination. More lying and misdirection instead of facts. More hatred towards people who aren’t WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants). More fear, uncertainty and doubt. More pro-theocratic thinking. Anti-women efforts. Pro-business/anti-citizen efforts. Support of the Constitution, but against the Government, because they don’t know how the Constitution works. Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns pv4-l\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.webp\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" class=\"db fullimage-noshadow\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:600px; max-width:600px;\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" class=\"db fullimage-noshadow\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:600px; max-width:600px;\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rankings-and-standings\"\u003eRankings and Standings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric.

        "plain":"As a political moderate who values sanity and evidence over emotional rage in politics, I really tried to keep an open mind about the various candidates from across the political spectrum. I wanted to listen to what they had to say, watch how respectfully they treated the other candidates — across party lines — and dissect and challenge their empty rhetoric.\nThis was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n  https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157624426458536/\n Things I believe in   We live in a digital world, that will continue to become more digital as time passes. We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see Net Neutrality).\n  God made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\n  As an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\n  I strongly support \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\n  I believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\n  My daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth. Why is she only worth 77% of a man in the workplace? I’ve seen/heard how women are treated in the dating scene and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\n  Why is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the Real Housewives of Wherever with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but it’s just a nipple.\n  The war on drugs was a failure, so let\u0026rsquo;s move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t change anybody but yourself\u0026rdquo; is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\n  We over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\n  Sex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026amp; 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u0026lt;5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\n  I am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\n  I support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting hearing and sight recovery, as well as ALS (a.k.a., Lou Gehrig’s Disease).\n  Changing jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\n  I absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote against, instead of telling why they themselves are worth voting for. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\n  I believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics. Anything we can do to break-apart the two-party system would be a fantastic improvement over what we have today.\n  The Tea Party is the American Taliban.\n   https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\n My background I was raised in a very conservative, Christian, Republican household. I was taught that you had to vote Republican because otherwise the evil Democrats will win. And although they never actually said it, I was definitely taught that Jesus votes Republican. It wasn’t until my mid-20’s that I started seriously reviewing the issues, asking hard questions about them, and seeing where things still stood up vs. where they fell down. In the end, I realized that most things I’d been taught, politically, didn’t stand-up to scrutiny very well. I also wasn’t a strong supporter of most of what the Democratic party stood for either, so I find myself as an Independent — neither major party represents me.\nWith the direction that the Republican party has taken over the last 20 years, I find that they represent me less and less with each passing year. My own observations have shown me: More discrimination. More lying and misdirection instead of facts. More hatred towards people who aren’t WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants). More fear, uncertainty and doubt. More pro-theocratic thinking. Anti-women efforts. Pro-business/anti-citizen efforts. Support of the Constitution, but against the Government, because they don’t know how the Constitution works. Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\n https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\n Rankings and Standings For me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric. There are zero people whom I agree with 100%. Some issues matter more to me than others, and based on the ones that matter, this is where I stand with the current candidates.\n  Definitely Yes: Larry Lessig, Bernie Sanders — Both are pro-citizen, are willing to listen to others, campaign finance reform, do NOT take an us-against-them stance, and support positive change for this country. They have not accepted any money from Super PACs, except for Larry Lessig who founded the MayDay Super PAC — “the Super PAC to end all Super PACs.” I disagree with Bernie Sanders’ stance on abortion, but fully support his stance on reproductive health, contraception, and sexual education.\n  Wouldn’t be Angry: Hillary Clinton — She’s pro-women and pro-minorities, which could help to lay the groundwork for when my daughter comes of age. I have not seen her do any mud-slinging thus far, except to suggest that she disagrees with much of what was discussed during the Republican debates. At the same time, she’s done some really shady things around sending top-secret emails though her personal email server (!!), and she supports treating Edward Snowden like a domestic terrorist. She’s also raised most of her money from Super PACs.\n  Would be irritated: Rand Paul — He’s been really hit-or-miss so far. He started his campaign by slinging mud and rhetoric against Hillary Clinton instead of telling us why we should vote for him. He supports simplifying the tax code (yay!) but is against Net Neutrality (boo!). He is also a candidate that has enjoyed using the rhetorical call-to-action “we need to take America back” without ever explaining what on earth that even means. Back to the Salem Witch Trials? Back to slavery and segregation? Back to when women couldn’t vote? Back to the recession, multiple wars, and the Credit Crisis from last decade?\n  OMGWTFBBQ: Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina — Ted Cruz wants to kill the Ayatollah and thinks that Net Neutrality is ObamaCare for the Internet. Mike Huckabee believes that it’s perfectly OK for a government employee to violate the Constitution because it’s against Kim Davis’ faith to support gay marriage. Of course, so is sex outside of marriage and divorcing for reasons other than infidelity or abandonment¹²³⁴, but who’s counting? The others, I simply disagree with on the majority of issues — at least in cases where they are clear where they stand.\n  The worst possible thing for America: Donald Trump — Misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, sexist, selfish, pro-business at the cost of individual citizens, enthusiastically leverages tax/legal loopholes for personal gain, and is a supporter of continued “cronyism” in government. Although, I agree with him that we should stop buying oil from foreign nations, and should instead rely on ourselves.\n  I am most-aligned with Elizabeth Warren, although she isn’t running — this time around, anyway.\n https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\n ",

Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n\n## Rankings and Standings\n\nFor me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric. There are zero people whom I agree with 100%. Some issues matter more to me than others, and based on the ones that matter, this is where I stand with the current candidates.\n\n1. **Definitely Yes:** [Larry Lessig]({{\u003c wayback \"https://lessig2016.us/\" \u003e}}), [Bernie Sanders]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Bernie_Sanders.htm\" \u003e}}) — Both are pro-citizen, are willing to listen to others, campaign finance reform, do NOT take an _us-against-them_ stance, and support positive change for this country. They have not accepted any money from Super PACs, except for Larry Lessig who founded the [MayDay Super PAC]({{\u003c wayback \"https://mayday.us\" \u003e}}) — “the Super PAC to end all Super PACs.” I disagree with Bernie Sanders’ stance on abortion, but fully support his stance on reproductive health, contraception, and sexual education.\n\n1. **Wouldn’t be Angry:** [Hillary Clinton]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Hillary_Clinton.htm\" \u003e}}) — She’s pro-women and pro-minorities, which could help to lay the groundwork for when my daughter comes of age. I have not seen her do any mud-slinging thus far, except to suggest that she disagrees with much of what was discussed during the Republican debates. At the same time, she’s done some really shady things around sending top-secret emails though her personal email server (!!), and she supports treating [Edward Snowden](/2013/11/14/fisa-the-nsa-prism-and-edward-snowden/) like a domestic terrorist. She’s also raised most of her money from Super PACs.\n\n1. **Would be irritated:** [Rand Paul]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Rand_Paul.htm\" \u003e}}) — He’s been really hit-or-miss so far. He started his campaign by [slinging mud and rhetoric against Hillary Clinton]({{\u003c wayback \"https://randpaul.com/liberty-not-hillary\" \u003e}}) instead of telling us why we should vote for him. He supports simplifying the tax code (yay!) but is against Net Neutrality (boo!). He is also a candidate that has enjoyed using the rhetorical call-to-action “[we need to take America back]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ftVjxNrvw\" \u003e}})” without ever explaining what on earth that even means. Back to the Salem Witch Trials? Back to slavery and segregation? Back to when women couldn’t vote? Back to the recession, multiple wars, and the [Credit Crisis]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0zEXdDO5JU\" \u003e}}) from last decade?\n\n1. **OMGWTFBBQ:** [Ted Cruz]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Ted_Cruz.htm\" \u003e}}), [Jeb Bush]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm\" \u003e}}), [Mike Huckabee]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Huckabee.htm\" \u003e}}), [Carly Fiorina]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Carly_Fiorina.htm\" \u003e}}) — [Ted Cruz wants to kill the Ayatollah]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/25/ted-cruz-threatens-to-kill-the-ayatollah.html\" \u003e}}) and thinks that [Net Neutrality is ObamaCare for the Internet]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/ted-cruz-net-neutrality_n_6133584.html\" \u003e}}). Mike Huckabee believes that [it’s perfectly OK for a government employee to violate the Constitution]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-jail-huckabee_55ef258be4b093be51bc5dcc\" \u003e}}) because it’s against [Kim Davis’ faith to support gay marriage]({{\u003c wayback \"http://m.snopes.com/kim-davis-married-four-times/\" \u003e}}). Of course, so is sex outside of marriage and divorcing for reasons other than infidelity or abandonment[¹]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/deu.24.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[²]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/mat.5.31-33.kjv\" \u003e}})[³]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/rom.7.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[⁴]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/1co.7\" \u003e}}), but who’s counting? The others, I simply disagree with on the majority of issues — at least in cases where they are clear where they stand.\n\n1. **The worst possible thing for America:** [Donald Trump]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\" \u003e}}) — Misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, sexist, selfish, pro-business at the cost of individual citizens, enthusiastically leverages tax/legal loopholes for personal gain, and is a supporter of continued “cronyism” in government. Although, I agree with him that we should stop buying oil from foreign nations, and should instead rely on ourselves.\n\nI am most-aligned with [Elizabeth Warren]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm\" \u003e}}), although she isn’t running — this time around, anyway.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/vote-moderate.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n"},
