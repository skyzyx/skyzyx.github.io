It's a heart problem, not a gun problem. Jeremiah 17:9\" figure=\"“TRUTH!!!”, my friend exclaimed.\" width=\"497\"\u003e}}\n\nAs a rational person who values evidence and critical thinking, this photo misses the point by grossly oversimplifying a very complex issue. And while it maybe be _technically_ true, that’s only in the most ideal sociological conditions.\n\nThe real world is far more complex.\n\n(Instead of being flippant and dismissive toward people you disagree with, challenge the things that you think you know. See if those ideas hold-up to scrutiny when the hard questions are asked. I did, and I realized that there were some really good, valid points being made by both sides of the gun ownership issue. Take the time to listen to what other people think, and why they think it, and you might see a perspective you hadn’t seen before.)\n\n## It’s far too easy…\n\nIt's not about the gun, per sé, but it is definitely about the ability to commit mass-murder with a gun. I've never seen or heard of anybody committing mass-murder with a rock.\n\nWe have invented procedures and invested in research and development to make cars safer, airplanes safer, construction equipment safer, kitchen appliances safer, etc. Why isn't the weapons industry investing into better procedures and security for weapons?\n\nNeither a \"heart\" nor a rock are able to [kill 50 people in a nightclub within minutes]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article83297102.html\" \u003e}}). A rock _could_ be used to [kill a 22 year old singer who is signing autographs after a concert]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/us/christina-grimmie-singer-on-the-voice-dies-in-shooting-at-concert.html\" \u003e}}). However, if by investing more effort into background checks and psychological evaluations, or by inventing biometrics safety techniques or other methods which prevent accidental gun deaths, how many lives could be saved?\n\n## Two sides of the same coin.\n\nI strongly support _responsible_ gun ownership **AND** strong gun control laws. Those are not opposing ideas, but rather complementary ones. I personally believe there is value in more people being armed — primarily people performing security roles at schools, malls and airports. Looking at someone and expecting that they are packing heat will keep your actions in check.\n\nBut I also believe that asking people to undergo a psychological evaluation is not an unreasonable request. Neither is closing the _gun show_ loophole, or asking people to certify before they can legally own a gun (and re-certify every few years, like a driver's license), or requiring a class which educates you on responsible, legal gun ownership versus hand-me-down stories of what can do (or get away with) with a gun.\n\n(For example, it is a federal crime to shoot down an operational aircraft — including a drone — that is flying in the airspace above your property. You may own the land, but you do not own the air above it.)\n\nIt is a 100% perfect system? Absolutely not. A determined person will **always** find a way to do whatever they’re going to do. But just because the idea or implementation is not 100% perfect doesn't mean that _we shouldn't bother doing anything at all_.\n\n## Guns don't kill people, but we can do _better_.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/gun-murders.jpg\" alt=\"The United States has 3–4× the number of gun-related murders per capita than any other modern, civilized nation. This does not include accidental gun-related deaths.\" figure=\"The United States has 3–4× the number of gun-related murders per capita than any other modern, civilized nation. This does not include accidental gun-related deaths.\"\u003e}}\n\nGuns don't kill people. _People kill people_. But that doesn’t absolve our society of responsibility for the actions that we allow our people to take.\n\nYes, it is true that people kill people. But a gun in the hands of a dangerous person is capable of taking a substantially higher number of lives at once than nearly any other weapon humankind has ever devised[^1]. We do not show enough respect for this dangerous capability as we should as a society.\n\n[^1]: Bombs are capable of killing even _more_ people than guns. But guns are also much easier to access legally.\n\nWhat if we could reduce gun-related deaths by 20%… 30%… 40%? Would that be worth it? Are the lives of those people are worth it? Are the lives of the kids at Sandy Hook Elementary worth it? Are the lives of the reporter and cameraman who were gunned-down on-air worth it? Are the lives of the kids who get a hold of their parents’ gun and accidentally kill themselves, their parent, or their siblings worth it?\n\nGuns are far too easy to purchase through legal channels because of well-known loopholes in the system. By closing the legal loopholes, law enforcement can spend more time focusing on covering illegal gun sales.\n\n## Justifying an outrageous failure\n\nFrance, Germany, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Australia, Spain, and even the Czech Republic are ahead of us on this issue. For a country which claims to be _the best country in the entire world_, how can we continue to justify such an outrageous failure of our society?\n\nGun control does **not** mean _taking away your guns_. It doesn’t mean a _disarmament_ of you and your family (unless your family is crazy, of course). It refers to the _enforcement of the responsibility_ of owning a gun. You’re responsible, right?\n\nThe founding fathers granted us the right to form and maintain a militia… using **muskets**. They did not know that one day the weapons industry would rake-in _billions of dollars per year_. They did not know that our society would shift from being primarily rural to being primarily urban/industrial. It does not mean that you are **guaranteed** the right to own _assault weapons_.\n\n## How much longer?\n\nHow long are we going to stand by and do nothing (except pray) while angry/crazy people shoot-up large groups of people? How long are we going to update our Facebook profile photos with the French flag, or hear about **yet another** mass-shooting (San Bernadino, Orlando, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, etc.), and choose to do **absolutely nothing at all** about lifting a finger to make things better?\n\nBecause guns. Or politics. Or religion that has been tainted by politics. They have propagandized the heck out of the second amendment, and the gun industry is — ahem — making a “killing” in revenue.\n\nI have concerns about unfettered gun ownership. I’m sure that you also have your own concerns about the gun ownership issue. But we certainly recognize that a problem exists, right? That mass-shooting after mass-shooting is not _normal_, right? We don’t live in central Africa, or Colombia, or Mexico City, right?\n\nWe need to work together to come up with something better than what we have today.

You agree that having a waiting period is a good thing, right?

THAT is the definition of “gun control” — the rules by which people can buy, sell, and own guns (which, may I remind you, are _some_ of the most dangerous weapons that humankind has ever invented).\n\nYou wouldn’t hand a toddler a hunting knife, would you?\n\n## Update ({{\u003cdate \"2018-08-05\"\u003e}})\n\nMaybe I was wrong.

That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd follows that up with an important premise:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lastly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government.

The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-a-better-america\"\u003eMaking A Better America\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ePhoto by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen \u003cem\u003edramatically\u003c/em\u003e since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works.

        "plain":"In response to “I moved to the US 7 years ago from Finland — here's what Americans don't understand about Nordic countries”, and why I support Bernie Sanders. This was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s what Americans don\u0026rsquo;t understand about Nordic countries Anu Partanen, writing for The Atlantic:\n Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Bernie Sanders ’ Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they\u0026rsquo;d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\nA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\nThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\n And follows that up with an important premise:\n But this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for me.\n And lastly,\n Americans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government. In fact, as a proud Finn, I often like to remind my American friends that my countrymen in Finland fought two brutal wars against the Soviet Union to preserve Finland\u0026rsquo;s freedom and independence against socialism. No one wants to live in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support individual liberty, entrepreneurship, and open markets.\nBut the truth is that free-market capitalism and universal social policies go well together — this isn\u0026rsquo;t about big government, it\u0026rsquo;s about smart government.\n This is a very good piece, and I hope you can take a few minutes to read it all. In the U.S., and especially among the Boomer generation, they hear \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and tend to equate it with Russian communism (which was actually never communism, but rather a dictator-style totalitarian socialism).\nToo Much Capitalism Is Bad For You  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/5065175199/in/album-72157652056682098/\n For me, I see the pros and cons of such a capitalistic-driven society. The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\nSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\nMaking A Better America  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\n I want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen dramatically since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\nWhat I’m currently hearing from Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , and Rand Paul is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again and including all Americans in that plan.\nUnfair?

America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026 fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\n\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don't think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government's role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026 fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\n\n## Making A Better America\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \"bitch\" or a \"whore\" just because she doesn't want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\n\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen *dramatically* since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don't know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nWhat I’m currently hearing from {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}}, {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}}, and {{\u003c person name=\"Rand Paul\" \u003e}} is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again **and** including all Americans in that plan.\n\n## Unfair?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/ignoring-the-obvious.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/22122675480/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nYes, a 60 year old couple with no kids paying more money in taxes so that some other couple can have their kids in better daycare sounds unfair at first. But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don't like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they're not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn't want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\n\nMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing. By raising-up the foundation for everyone, everybody benefits, albeit indirectly.\n\n## Support the Radical Center\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/losing-our-competitive-edge.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nLastly, I think our current 2-party system is the most toxic aspect of American politics. What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you **must** vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate. The Republican party has already assumed that Clinton will win the nomination on the Democratic side, but the race between herself and Sanders is extremely close. Conversely, the fact that loose cannons like {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}} and {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}} have made it as far as they have over more sane and level-headed candidates like {{\u003c person name=\"Rand Paul\" \u003e}} and {{\u003c person name=\"Marco Rubio\" \u003e}} is saddening.\n\nThe only way to break free of the 2-party system is to stop reinforcing this 2-party mentality. IMO, it’s toxic to the American people that the RNC and the DNC are private corporations who pay for broadcast airtime, and can change the rules to determine who can/cannot be part of the debates. This leads to _Tweedism_, and further separates the voters from the nomination process (in addition to _super-delegates_ and the _electoral college_).\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"tweedism\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/pFZEV7TeZBg\"\n       sourceTitle=\"Lessig at MIT: \\\"Tweedism\\\"\"\n\u003e}}\n\nI would also love to see the entire population of the United States abstain from the next election until we could vote on meaningful campaign finance reform, but that will never happen.\n\n## Reform\n\nUltimately, however, none of the promises made by presidential candidates will come to pass without [substantial campaign finance reform]({{\u003c search \"campaign finance reform 2017\" \u003e}}). Congress decides on the budget, and it is the President’s job to spend that budget. With so many congresspeople in the pockets of large corporations instead of working in the best interests of the citizens they represent, there is little that will be accomplished until we achieve meaningful reform. With {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}} taking money from the Oil \u0026 Coal industries, with {{\u003c person name=\"Hillary Clinton\" \u003e}} taking money from Wall Street, and with {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}} taking money from the KKK, we’re all in big trouble.\n\n[Citizen-funded elections]({{\u003c wayback \"http://lessig2016.us/the-plan/\" \u003e}}) is the only way to achieve this.\n\n## P.S.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/check-their-facts.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nI would rather see the debates on both sides handled like _The Newsroom_, where any claims made by candidates are immediately fact-checked and untrue answers are discarded.\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"newsroom-mock-debate\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/AF-BZsrtoPs\"\n       sourceTitle=\"HBO: The Newsroom EP9 \\\"Mock Debate\\\"¹\"\n\u003e}}\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"footnotes\"\u003e\n  \u003chr\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"f6 gray\"\u003eFeatured image by \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/diversey/15325678721/in/album-72157647164491333/\"\u003eTony Webster\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"f6 gray\"\u003e¹ Fair use, copyright exemption claim: Low-quality version of the clip used for the purpose of educating readers about the importance of fact-checking the rhetoric that is commonplace in the American political system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n"},

We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable.

You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the  education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed.

        "plain":"As a political moderate who values sanity and evidence over emotional rage in politics, I really tried to keep an open mind about the various candidates from across the political spectrum. I wanted to listen to what they had to say, watch how respectfully they treated the other candidates — across party lines — and dissect and challenge their empty rhetoric.\nThis was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n  https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157624426458536/\n Things I believe in   We live in a digital world, that will continue to become more digital as time passes. We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see Net Neutrality).\n  God made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\n  As an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\n  I strongly support \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\n  I believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\n  My daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth. Why is she only worth 77% of a man in the workplace? I’ve seen/heard how women are treated in the dating scene and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\n  Why is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the Real Housewives of Wherever with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but it’s just a nipple.\n  The war on drugs was a failure, so let\u0026rsquo;s move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t change anybody but yourself\u0026rdquo; is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\n  We over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\n  Sex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026amp; 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u0026lt;5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\n  I am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\n  I support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting hearing and sight recovery, as well as ALS (a.k.a., Lou Gehrig’s Disease).\n  Changing jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\n  I absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote against, instead of telling why they themselves are worth voting for. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\n  I believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics. Anything we can do to break-apart the two-party system would be a fantastic improvement over what we have today.\n  The Tea Party is the American Taliban.\n   https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\n My background I was raised in a very conservative, Christian, Republican household.

We live in a digital world, that will continue to become more digital as time passes. We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see [Net Neutrality]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality\" \u003e}})).\n\n1. God made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\n\n1. As an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\n\n1. I strongly support \"freedom\" in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\n\n1. I believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\n\n1. My daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth. Why is she only worth 77% of a man in the workplace? I’ve seen/heard how [women are treated in the dating scene](https://instagram.com/byefelipe/) and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\n\n1. Why is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the _Real Housewives of Wherever_ with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but _it’s just a nipple_.\n\n1. The war on drugs was a failure, so let's move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \"you can't change anybody but yourself\" is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\n\n1. We over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\n\n1. Sex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u003c5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\n\n1. I am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the  education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\n\n1. I support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting [hearing and sight recovery]({{\u003c wayback \"http://stemcells.nih.gov/research/scilit/highlights/pages/default.aspx\" \u003e}}), as well as ALS (a.k.a., [Lou Gehrig’s Disease]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.webmd.com/brain/features/als-stem-cell-patient-trial\" \u003e}})). \n\n1. Changing jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\n\n1. I absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote _against_, instead of telling why they themselves are worth _voting for_. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\n\n1. I believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics. Anything we can do to break-apart the two-party system would be a fantastic improvement over what we have today.\n\n1. [The Tea Party is the American Taliban.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGAvwSp86hY)\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/check-their-facts.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n\n## My background\n\nI was raised in a very conservative, Christian, Republican household. I was taught that you had to vote Republican because otherwise the evil Democrats will win. And although they never actually said it, I was definitely taught that _Jesus votes Republican_. It wasn’t until my mid-20’s that I started seriously reviewing the issues, asking hard questions about them, and seeing where things still stood up vs. where they fell down. In the end, I realized that most things I’d been taught, politically, didn’t stand-up to scrutiny very well. I also wasn’t a strong supporter of most of what the Democratic party stood for either, so I find myself as an Independent — neither major party represents me.\n\nWith the direction that the Republican party has taken over the last 20 years, I find that they represent me less and less with each passing year. My own observations have shown me: More discrimination. More lying and misdirection instead of facts. More hatred towards people who aren’t WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants). More fear, uncertainty and doubt. More pro-theocratic thinking. Anti-women efforts. Pro-business/anti-citizen efforts. Support of the Constitution, but against the Government, because they don’t know how the Constitution works. Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n\n## Rankings and Standings\n\nFor me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric. There are zero people whom I agree with 100%. Some issues matter more to me than others, and based on the ones that matter, this is where I stand with the current candidates.\n\n1. **Definitely Yes:** [Larry Lessig]({{\u003c wayback \"https://lessig2016.us/\" \u003e}}), [Bernie Sanders]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Bernie_Sanders.htm\" \u003e}}) — Both are pro-citizen, are willing to listen to others, campaign finance reform, do NOT take an _us-against-them_ stance, and support positive change for this country. They have not accepted any money from Super PACs, except for Larry Lessig who founded the [MayDay Super PAC]({{\u003c wayback \"https://mayday.us\" \u003e}}) — “the Super PAC to end all Super PACs.” I disagree with Bernie Sanders’ stance on abortion, but fully support his stance on reproductive health, contraception, and sexual education.\n\n1. **Wouldn’t be Angry:** [Hillary Clinton]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Hillary_Clinton.htm\" \u003e}}) — She’s pro-women and pro-minorities, which could help to lay the groundwork for when my daughter comes of age. I have not seen her do any mud-slinging thus far, except to suggest that she disagrees with much of what was discussed during the Republican debates. At the same time, she’s done some really shady things around sending top-secret emails though her personal email server (!!), and she supports treating [Edward Snowden](/2013/11/14/fisa-the-nsa-prism-and-edward-snowden/) like a domestic terrorist. She’s also raised most of her money from Super PACs.\n\n1. **Would be irritated:** [Rand Paul]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Rand_Paul.htm\" \u003e}}) — He’s been really hit-or-miss so far. He started his campaign by [slinging mud and rhetoric against Hillary Clinton]({{\u003c wayback \"https://randpaul.com/liberty-not-hillary\" \u003e}}) instead of telling us why we should vote for him. He supports simplifying the tax code (yay!) but is against Net Neutrality (boo!). He is also a candidate that has enjoyed using the rhetorical call-to-action “[we need to take America back]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ftVjxNrvw\" \u003e}})” without ever explaining what on earth that even means. Back to the Salem Witch Trials? Back to slavery and segregation? Back to when women couldn’t vote? Back to the recession, multiple wars, and the [Credit Crisis]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0zEXdDO5JU\" \u003e}}) from last decade?\n\n1. **OMGWTFBBQ:** [Ted Cruz]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Ted_Cruz.htm\" \u003e}}), [Jeb Bush]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm\" \u003e}}), [Mike Huckabee]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Huckabee.htm\" \u003e}}), [Carly Fiorina]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Carly_Fiorina.htm\" \u003e}}) — [Ted Cruz wants to kill the Ayatollah]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/25/ted-cruz-threatens-to-kill-the-ayatollah.html\" \u003e}}) and thinks that [Net Neutrality is ObamaCare for the Internet]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/ted-cruz-net-neutrality_n_6133584.html\" \u003e}}). Mike Huckabee believes that [it’s perfectly OK for a government employee to violate the Constitution]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-jail-huckabee_55ef258be4b093be51bc5dcc\" \u003e}}) because it’s against [Kim Davis’ faith to support gay marriage]({{\u003c wayback \"http://m.snopes.com/kim-davis-married-four-times/\" \u003e}}). Of course, so is sex outside of marriage and divorcing for reasons other than infidelity or abandonment[¹]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/deu.24.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[²]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/mat.5.31-33.kjv\" \u003e}})[³]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/rom.7.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[⁴]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/1co.7\" \u003e}}), but who’s counting? The others, I simply disagree with on the majority of issues — at least in cases where they are clear where they stand.\n\n1. **The worst possible thing for America:** [Donald Trump]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\" \u003e}}) — Misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, sexist, selfish, pro-business at the cost of individual citizens, enthusiastically leverages tax/legal loopholes for personal gain, and is a supporter of continued “cronyism” in government. Although, I agree with him that we should stop buying oil from foreign nations, and should instead rely on ourselves.\n\nI am most-aligned with [Elizabeth Warren]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm\" \u003e}}), although she isn’t running — this time around, anyway.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/vote-moderate.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n"},

The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” […]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb addresses are rich and revealing content.

        "plain":"I’ve been paying quite a bit of attention to the story of Edward Snowden — the former CIA contractor who leaked classified information to the American public about how the government is spying on us through acronym-laden programs known as “PRISM” and “MUSCULAR”.   Allow me to be your tour guide as we uncover just a few of the ways in which the NSA has broken the law and spied on American citizens.\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978) It all started in 1978 with the passage of FISA:\n The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (“FISA” Pub.L. 95–511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. ch. 36) is a United States federal law which prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of “foreign intelligence information” between “foreign powers” and “agents of foreign powers” (which may include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of espionage or terrorism). The law does not apply outside the United States. It has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks.\n FISA was amended in 2001 by The Patriot Act:\n The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. […]\nOn May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the “library records provision”), and conducting surveillance of “lone wolves”—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.\n Then again by the Protect America Act of 2007:\n The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), (Pub.L. 110–55, 121 Stat. 552, enacted by S. 1927), is a controversial amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on August 5, 2007. It removed the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets “reasonably believed” to be outside of the United States. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.\n And yet again by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008:\n Warrantless wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) was revealed publicly in late 2005 by the New York Times and then discontinued in January 2007. […] Approximately forty lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies by groups and individuals alleging that the Bush administration illegally monitored their phone calls or e-mails. Whistleblower evidence suggests that AT\u0026amp;T was complicit in the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, which could have involved the private communications of millions of Americans.\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to * 10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. In addition, the Wiretap Act prohibits any person from illegally intercepting, disclosing, using, or divulging phone calls or electronic communications; this is punishable with a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.\n (All 3 sets of amendments to FISA were passed by Congresses operating during the George W. Bush administration.)\nEdward Snowden , Whistleblower   In May 2013, Edward Snowden ’s leak of Top Secret-level NSA material was called “the most significant leak in U.S. history” by Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers (1971).\nThe U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government secrets. President Obama’s response was reported by Z. Byron Wolf, writing for CNN:\n Even as he announced changes to the NSA programs, including the appointment of an independent government review, at a news conference on Friday, Obama suggested Americans would be better off if they hadn’t found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and Internet data.\n“No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,” Obama said. A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn’t know existed.\nThe leaks, he said, hurt that process.\n Conor Friedersdorf, writing for The Atlantic, talks about why pardoning the whistleblower would be more moral and legal than Team Obama’s treatment of Bush-era interrogators:\n Circa 2008, Barack Obama gave his supporters reason to believe that if he were elected, he would protect whistleblowers and obey U.S. law on the subject of torture.\nHe has disappointed on both subjects.\nLong before Edward Snowden exposed mass surveillance on Americans by the NSA, the Obama Administration was aggressively persecuting former civil servants who blew the whistle on objectionable behavior during the Bush Administration.\n Edward Snowden, in A Manifesto for the Truth:\n Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress this debate. They intimidated journalists and criminalized publishing the truth. At this point, the public was not yet able to evaluate the benefits of the revelations. They relied on their governments to decide correctly. […]\nCitizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public importance. To tell the truth is not a crime.\n The American public’s view has been polarized. Here is what Wikipedia’s entry on Edward Snowden says:\n He has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor, and a patriot. Response from US officials has been similarly varied; Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned Snowden’s actions as having done “huge, grave damage” to US intelligence capabilities, while United States Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the NSA had gone “too far” in some of its surveillance activities and promised that it would be stopped.\n  “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”\n— Mark Twain  Rory Carroll, writing for The Guardian, says that the White House has chosen to reject clemency for Edward Snowden.\n The former NSA employee this week appealed for clemency and an opportunity to address members of Congress about US surveillance. He also asked for international help to lobby the US to drop the charges against him. The White House, stung by domestic and international criticism, has shown growing appetite to rein in some of the NSA programmes that Snowden exposed but it has not softened its hostility to the 30-year-old fugitive. […]\nFeinstein, a Democratic senator from California, remained implacable. “He’s done this enormous disservice to our country. I think the answer is ‘no clemency’,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation.\nThe former NSA contractor could have blown the whistle on excesses by contacting the House and Senate intelligence committees, Feinstein said. “We would certainly have seen him … and looked at that information. That didn’t happen.”\n The NSA’s PRISM program   The information that was leaked by Snowden outlined the PRISM program, run by the NSA. Here is what we’ve learned so far.\nChris Gayomali, writing for the The Week, says that “The United States has allegedly been spying on its own allies”.\n Perhaps the most damning new revelation is that the U.S. government may have been spying on friends as well as foes. Thirty-eight embassies and missions are outlined as “targets” on one document, reports the Guardian.\n Also that “PRISM allegedly collects data from companies in real time”.\n The Post suggests the FBI uses “government equipment on private company property” to retrieve information on a specified target, before it is then passed on to “customers” in either the NSA, CIA, or FBI. If true, this ostensibly allows the government’s data collection to proceed in real time. To refresh your memory: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, PayTalk, AOL, Skype, and YouTube were all reported to be taking part in the PRISM program.\nAnd yet, all the companies have “strenuously denied” involvement, says Mike Masnick at TechDirt, which doesn’t jibe with the Post’s own annotations. Based on the slides, “it’s not at all clear” that Data Intercept Technology Units (DITU) are physically located on private the premises of private companies:\n Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the “DITU” could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders. [TechDirt]\n  The Washington Post, in an article entitled “NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program”, shows slides from a classified presentation about PRISM’s purpose.\n The top-secret PRISM program allows the U.S. intelligence community to gain access from nine Internet companies to a wide range of digital information, including e-mails and stored data, on foreign targets operating outside the United States. The program is court-approved but does not require individual warrants. Instead, it operates under a broader authorization from federal judges who oversee the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Some documents describing the program were first released by The Washington Post on June 6. The newly released documents below give additional details about how the program operates, including the levels of review and supervisory control at the NSA and FBI. The documents also show how the program interacts with the Internet companies. These slides, annotated by The Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and certain portions are redacted.\n This presentation lists Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple as being the sources of data for PRISM.\n  Joshua Brustein, writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, has collected statements from all of the companies named in the leaked NSA documents.\n In a series of terse statement (sic), all the companies named in the reports about NSA’s Internet snooping program, Prism, have denied involvement. All these companies have been compelled to share personal data with the government at some time, which they tacitly acknowledge by saying they only do so after careful consideration and court orders. “Direct access” to servers, though, is a bridge too far, they say […].\n Dara Kerr, writing for CNET, says that “The tech giants [Apple, Google, Microsoft], along with Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL, call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to substantially reform the US government’s mass surveillance practices.”\n Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL penned a letter (pdf) to the lead members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday urging the lawmakers to substantially reform the NSA surveillance practices. The companies also asked for additional oversight and accountability mechanisms for the spying programs.\n“Transparency is a critical first step to an informed public debate, but it is clear that more needs to be done,” the letter reads. “We urge the Administration to work with Congress in addressing these critical reforms that would provide much needed transparency and help rebuild the trust of Internet users around the world.” […]\nThat document leak opened the public’s eyes to the government’s collection of data on US residents through both cellular records and metadata from Internet companies. Since Snowden’s original leak, thousands more documents have surfaced. The NSA and the Obama administration have maintained that the surveillance program was carried out to protect Americans and track down foreign terrorists.\n The piece continues, showing precisely how good intentions mean nothing in the real world.\n The letter sent by the tech companies “applauds” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) who recently sponsored a bill called the USA Freedom Act. This bill has the goal of “ending eavesdropping, dragnet collection, and online monitoring” by the NSA and other government agencies.\nSensenbrenner is considered one of the architects of the Patriot Act, which the NSA often cites as a legal justification for its surveillance activities. However, Sensenbrenner is adamant that mass government spying wasn’t the intention of the Patriot Act.\n“We have to make a balance between security and civil liberties,” Sensenbrenner told the Associated Press in an interview last week. “And the reason the intelligence community has gotten itself into such trouble is they apparently do not see why civil liberties have got to be protected.”\n Isn’t that against the law? You’ve asked a very complex question.\nIf you read up on FISA and its various amendments, it is very clear that for the American government to get information from American companies on American soil, they have to provide probable cause and get a warrant from a judge.\n  What they’ve done is not break the law, but rather go around it. The Guardian has an excellent presentation entitled “NSA Files: Decoded. What the revelations mean for you.” which does a terrific job explaining everything. I would encourage you to take some time learning from it.\n Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.\n What the NSA has done is partner with GCHQ (Britain’s equivalent agency) to tap the private fiber-optic cables that transfer digital data from continent to continent.\nInstead of the American government getting information from American companies on American soil, they’re getting it on British soil — which negates all of the oversight protections that American citizens expect.\nThe British parliament was very aware of the power they had over their own people, and colluded with the NSA to dodge American law. While it’s not technically a violation of FISA (which itself is being contested as unconstitutional), it is absolutely a violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n The ACLU published a piece entitled “Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act” which explains how the Patriot Act violates our Constitutional rights.\nWith regard to “Expanded access to personal records held by third parties”:\n Section 215 of the Patriot Act violates the Constitution in several ways. It:\n  Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.\n  Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.\n  Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.\n  Violates the Fourth Amendment by failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n   With regard to “secret searches”:\n The Patriot Act, however, unconstitutionally amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed. This means that the government can enter a house, apartment or office with a search warrant when the occupants are away, search through their property, take photographs, and in some cases even seize property - and not tell them until later.\nNotice is a crucial check on the government’s power because it forces the authorities to operate in the open, and allows the subject of searches to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. For example, it allows them to point out irregularities in a warrant, such as the fact that the police are at the wrong address, or that the scope of the warrant is being exceeded (for example, by rifling through dresser drawers in a search for a stolen car).\n With regard to “Expansion of the intelligence exception in wiretap law”:\n A 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) created an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for probable cause when the purpose of a wiretap or search was to gather foreign intelligence. The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\n With regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\n Under the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” […]\nWeb addresses are rich and revealing content. The URLs or “addresses” of the Web pages we read are not really addresses, they are the titles of documents that we download from the Internet. When we “visit” a Web page what we are really doing is downloading that page from the Internet onto our computer, where it is displayed. […] That is much richer information than a simple list of the people we have communicated with; it is intimate information that reveals who we are and what we are thinking about - much more like the content of a phone call than the number dialed. After all, it is often said that reading is a “conversation” with the author.\n In order for a federal law to be recognized as unconstitutional, a court case needs to go before the U.S. Supreme Court to be decided. Not many court cases against a federal agency have been able to make it that far, but on occasion, something gets caught.\n In January 2009, the FISA court was notified that the NSA had been querying business records metadata “in a manner that appear[ed] to the Court to be directly contrary” to the court’s order allowing it to so. In response, the FISA court ordered the government to explain itself. These documents detail this exchange as the NSA struggled to understand the business records program and ensure compliance.\n “The court is exceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its order in this matter and, while the court will not direct that specific officials of the executive branch provide sworn declarations in response to this order, the court expects that the declarants will be officials of sufficient stature that they have the authority to speak on behalf of the executive branch.”\n— Reggie Walton   Using this interactive diagram, you can see which laws, amendments and executive orders have enabled the NSA to operate as it currently does.\nSo, what are Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple doing about this? First of all, it needs to be clear that they never knowingly gave this kind of information to the NSA. The NSA colluded with the GCHQ to subvert American law by directly tapping the fiber optic cables that sends data between continents.\n GCHQ offices in England, UK\n Barton Gellman, Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson, writing for The Washington Post, explain “How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data” (emphasis mine).\n Immediately after the story posted online, a reporter asked NSA Director Keith B. Alexander about it at a cybersecurity event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Neither the reporter nor Alexander had read the story yet.\n General, we’re getting some news that’s crossing right now being reported in The Washington Post that there are new Snowden allegations that say the NSA broke into Yahoo and Google’s databases worldwide, that they infiltrated these databases?\n Alexander replied:\n That’s never happened. […] This is not the NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that. And so I don’t know what the report is, but I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\n The story did not say the NSA breaks into “servers” or “databases.” It said the agency, working with its British counterpart, intercepts communications that run on private circuits between the fortress-like data centers that each company operates on multiple continents.\nThe distinction is between “data at rest” and “data on the fly.” The NSA and GCHQ do not break into user accounts that are stored on Yahoo and Google computers. They intercept the information as it travels over fiber optic cables from one data center to another. […]\nThe two companies do not entrust their data center communications to the “public internet,” which is comparable to an international highway system that anyone can use. Instead, they link their data centers with thousands of miles of privately owned or privately leased fiber optic cable – in effect, a system of private highways. When Google and Yahoo have to share a stretch of road with the public internet, they take other precautions to keep their traffic secure. […]\nOur Wednesday story noted that the NSA is governed by fewer rules and less oversight when it does its intelligence collection outside U.S. territory:\n Intercepting communications overseas has clear advantages for the NSA, with looser restrictions and less oversight. NSA documents about the effort refer directly to “full take,” “bulk access” and “high volume” operations on Yahoo and Google networks. Such large-scale collection of Internet content would be illegal in the United States, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA is allowed to presume that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner.\nOutside U.S. territory, statutory restrictions on surveillance seldom apply and the FISC has no jurisdiction. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has acknowledged that Congress conducts little oversight of intelligence-gathering under the presidential authority of Executive Order 12333, which defines the basic powers and responsibilities of the intelligence agencies.\n  (EO 12333 was signed by Ronald Reagan . It was superseded and amended by EO 13355 and EO 13470, both signed by George W. Bush.)\nBrandon Downey , a security engineer at Google, had this to say:\n Fuck these guys.\nI’ve spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google’s users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces. […]\nIt makes me sad because I believe in America.\nNot in that flag-waving bullshit we’ve-got-our-big-trucks-and-bigger-tanks sort of way, but in the way that you can looked a good friend who has a lot of flaws, but every time you meet him, you think, “That guy still has some good ideas going on”.\nBut after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google — one of the greatest things to arise from the internet — seeing this, well, it’s just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\n Mike Hearn , another security engineer at Google, had this to say:\n I now join him in issuing a giant Fuck You to the people who made these slides. I am not American, I am a Brit, but it’s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.\nWe designed this system to keep criminals out. There’s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we’ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.\nUnfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.\nThank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\n Later, in the comments of his post, he explains the following:\n Encryption was being worked on prior to Snowden but it didn’t seem like a high priority because there was no evidence it would achieve anything useful, and it cost a lot of resources. Once it became clear how badly compromised the fiber paths were, there was a crash effort to encrypt everything.\n Sean Gallagher, writing for Ars Technica, says that “Googlers say ‘F*** you’ to NSA, company encrypts internal network”.\n Google has started to encrypt its traffic between its data centers, effectively halting the broad surveillance of its inner workings by the joint National Security Agency-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR. The move turns off a giant source of information to the two agencies, which at one point accounted for nearly a third of the NSA’s daily data intake for its primary intelligence analysis database—at least for now.\nAs of 2012, the NSA developed “defeat fingerprints” to scan the server-to-server communications that powered Google Adwords, Blogger, the BigTable database that powers Google Drive and other applications, and the TeraGoogle search index interface. These fingerprints allowed the NSA to scan Google internal traffic and identify elements associated with the usage of specific individuals or for searches and other behavior around a particular subject of interest (like, say, “pressure cooker bomb”). […]\nA second set of NSA tools, called Serendipity, gave the agency the ability to target specific Google accounts for monitoring as they accessed service, including:\n Chrome synchronization, including bookmark sync to the cloud “Talkgadget,” the Google Talk component of Gmail The now-defunct iGoogle personalized pages Google searches Picasa photo sharing YouTube […]  For Yahoo, the NSA had developed another set of hooks, fully accessing its internal mail protocols as well as its Messenger instant messaging service, advertising tracker, and “Web beacons” used to track whether users had opened HTML-formatted emails. And the agency had to respond to a flood of unwanted data from these sources by instituting blocks—mostly to deal with Yahoo’s periodic movement of entire user mailboxes.\n Chris Baraniuk, writing for Wired, says that Microsoft still doesn’t encrypt server-to-server data.\n A senior Microsoft executive has told a European parliamentary committee that the company does not encrypt its server-to-server data communications.\nDorothee Belz, EMEA VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, made the remark when answering a question from Claude Moraes, MEP, during a meeting at the European Parliament on Monday.\n“Generally, what I can say today is server-to-server transportation is generally not encrypted,” she said. “This is why we are currently reviewing our security system.” […]\nIt’s just one of several leaks by former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden that has concerned the EU’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) in a series of parliamentary hearings.\nPrior to taking questions from MEPs, Belz, who appeared alongside executives from Google and Facebook, reiterated earlier statements from Microsoft by stressing that the company did not openly provide “direct access” to its servers. However, her later admission that the firm has as yet failed to establish server-to-server encryption has raised fears among many within digital liberties groups that a significant breach of privacy could still be perpetrated.\nSam Smith, a technologist at Privacy International, said the unencrypted data could hypothetically relate to any of Microsoft’s cloud services, from Hotmail and Outlook.com email accounts to Xbox Live, Office 365, and SkyDrive cloud storage.\n What now?   The debate Snowden wanted is happening. That in itself is a major achievement.\n Public opinion is polarized over surveillance, but polls show a jump in concern over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations. A Pew poll at the end of July found that for the first time in a decade, the majority of Americans are more concerned about the government infringing on their civil liberties than about a potential terrorist attack. […]\nAccording to a recent study, the majority of Americans believe that preserving the rights of US citizens is more important than preventing terrorist attacks. Since the NSA revelations, Americans have become more opposed to government surveillance that infringes on civil liberties.\n People are turning to the court system more and more.\n In the end, it may be through the courts rather than Congress that genuine reform may come. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched lawsuits that have led to disclosure of hundreds of pages of Fisa (sic) rulings on Section 215. GCHQ and NSA surveillance is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights from Big Brother Watch, English PEN and Open Rights Group.\nSilicon Valley is also taking action through the courts. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, facing a backlash from their users in the US and overseas over mass surveillance, are fighting to be allowed to be more transparent about their dealings with the intelligence agencies. These companies, along with Facebook, Apple and AOL have also written to the Senate intelligence committee demanding reform.\n With as much hate and backbiting I’ve seen among American citizens and Congressional members since 2000, something strange has happened around this issue.\n There are now several major pieces of legislation going through Congress that would introduce at least some reform of the NSA. Among those, the one backed by Feinstein and passed by her committee is the least radical, offering proposals for greater transparency but basically maintaining the status quo. The bulk collection of Americans’ phone call data would be enshrined in US law.\nMore far-reaching is the proposed Intelligence Oversight and Reform Act, with bipartisan support from senators Wyden, Udall, Richard Blumenthal and Rand Paul. It would ban the collection of internet communication data; close loopholes that allow snooping on Americans without a warrant; reform the Fisa court; and provide some protection for companies faced with handing over data to the NSA.\n What about Edward Snowden? After leaving Hawai’i and his job as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong before winding up in Moscow, where Russian President Vladimir Putin granted him temporary asylum and protection from the U.S. government.\nHe most certainly has a rough road ahead of him. There’s no way you can piss-off the U.S. government as badly as he has and plan to remain free forever. Then again, they also said that about Bobby Fischer.\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said:\n “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.”\n I, for one, consider Edward Snowden a hero and a patriot to the highest degree.\nUpdate (2013–12–09) Aol, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! have all gotten together and put forward this new initiative: ReformGovernmentSurviellance.com.\nI’m disappointed that Apple isn’t on this list.\n",

The law does not apply outside the United States. It has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks.\n\nFISA was amended in 2001 by [The Patriot Act]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act\" %}}):\n\n\u003e The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President {{\u003c person name=\"George W. Bush\" \u003e}} on October 26, 2001. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e On May 26, 2011, President {{\u003c person name=\"Barack Obama\" \u003e}} signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the “library records provision”), and conducting surveillance of “lone wolves”—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.\n\nThen again by the [Protect America Act of 2007]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_America_Act_of_2007\" %}}):\n\n\u003e The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), (Pub.L. 110–55, 121 Stat. 552, enacted by S. 1927), is a controversial amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on August 5, 2007. It removed the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets “reasonably believed” to be outside of the United States. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.\n\nAnd yet again by the [FISA Amendments Act of 2008]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FISA_Amendments_Act_of_2008\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Warrantless wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) was revealed publicly in late 2005 by the New York Times and then discontinued in January 2007. \\[…\\] Approximately forty lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies by groups and individuals alleging that the Bush administration illegally monitored their phone calls or e-mails. Whistleblower evidence suggests that AT\u0026T was complicit in the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, which could have involved the private communications of millions of Americans.\n\u003e\n\u003e The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to * 10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. In addition, the Wiretap Act prohibits any person from illegally intercepting, disclosing, using, or divulging phone calls or electronic communications; this is punishable with a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.\n\n(All 3 sets of amendments to FISA were passed by Congresses operating during the George W. Bush administration.)\n\n\n## {{\u003c person name=\"Edward Snowden\" \u003e}}, Whistleblower\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/snowden@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nIn May 2013, {{\u003c person name=\"Edward Snowden\" \u003e}}’s leak of *Top Secret*-level NSA material was called [“the most significant leak in U.S. history”]({{% wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/edward-snowden-daniel-ellsberg-whistleblower-history_n_3413545.html\" %}}) by Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers (1971).\n\nThe U.S. government has [charged Snowden with espionage]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-charges-snowden-with-espionage/2013/06/21/507497d8-dab1-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html\" %}}) and [theft of government secrets]({{% wayback \"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/us-vs-edward-j-snowden-criminal-complaint/496/\" %}}).

A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn’t know existed.\n\u003e\n\u003e The leaks, he said, hurt that process.\n\nConor Friedersdorf, [writing for The Atlantic]({{% wayback \"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/clemency-for-torturers-but-not-for-edward-snowden/281142/\" %}}), talks about why pardoning the whistleblower would be more moral and legal than Team Obama’s treatment of Bush-era interrogators:\n\n\u003e Circa 2008, Barack Obama gave his supporters reason to believe that if he were elected, he would protect whistleblowers and obey U.S. law on the subject of torture.\n\u003e\n\u003e He has disappointed on both subjects.\n\u003e\n\u003e Long before Edward Snowden exposed mass surveillance on Americans by the NSA, the Obama Administration was aggressively persecuting former civil servants who blew the whistle on objectionable behavior during the Bush Administration.\n\nEdward Snowden, in [A Manifesto for the Truth]({{% wayback \"http://www.globalresearch.ca/a-manifesto-for-the-truth/5356919\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress this debate.

They relied on their governments to decide correctly. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Citizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public importance.

Response from US officials has been similarly varied; Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned Snowden’s actions as having done “huge, grave damage” to US intelligence capabilities, while United States Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the NSA had gone “too far” in some of its surveillance activities and promised that it would be stopped.\n\n\u003e “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — {{\u003c person name=\"Mark Twain\" \u003e}}\n\nRory Carroll, [writing for The Guardian]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/white-house-nsa-edward-snowden-clemency\" %}}), says that the White House has chosen to reject clemency for Edward Snowden.\n\n\u003e The former NSA employee this week appealed for clemency and an opportunity to address members of Congress about US surveillance. He also asked for international help to lobby the US to drop the charges against him. The White House, stung by domestic and international criticism, has shown growing appetite to rein in some of the NSA programmes that Snowden exposed but it has not softened its hostility to the 30-year-old fugitive. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Feinstein, a Democratic senator from California, remained implacable. “He’s done this enormous disservice to our country. I think the answer is ‘no clemency’,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation.\n\u003e\n\u003e The former NSA contractor could have blown the whistle on excesses by contacting the House and Senate intelligence committees, Feinstein said. “We would certainly have seen him … and looked at that information. That didn’t happen.”\n\n\n## The NSA’s PRISM program\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/prism@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nThe information that was leaked by Snowden outlined the PRISM program, run by the NSA. Here is what we’ve learned so far.\n\nChris Gayomali, [writing for the The Week]({{% wayback \"http://theweek.com/article/index/246349/3-big-revelations-from-the-newly-leaked-nsa-documents\" %}}), says that “The United States has allegedly been spying on its own allies”.\n\n\u003e Perhaps the most damning new revelation is that the U.S. government may have been spying on friends as well as foes. Thirty-eight embassies and missions are outlined as “targets” on one document, reports the Guardian.\n\nAlso that “PRISM allegedly collects data from companies in real time”.\n\n\u003e The Post suggests the FBI uses “government equipment on private company property” to retrieve information on a specified target, before it is then passed on to “customers” in either the NSA, CIA, or FBI. If true, this ostensibly allows the government’s data collection to proceed in real time. To refresh your memory: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, PayTalk, AOL, Skype, and YouTube were all reported to be taking part in the PRISM program.\n\u003e\n\u003e And yet, all the companies have “strenuously denied” involvement, says Mike Masnick at TechDirt, which doesn’t jibe with the Post’s own annotations. Based on the slides, “it’s not at all clear” that Data Intercept Technology Units (DITU) are physically located on private the premises of private companies:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the “DITU” could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders. \\[[TechDirt]({{% wayback \"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130701/00444723675/newly-leaked-nsa-slides-prism-add-to-confusion-rather-than-clear-it-up.shtml\" %}})\\]\n\n*The Washington Post*, in an article entitled [“NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program”]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/\" %}}), shows slides from a classified presentation about PRISM’s purpose.\n\n\u003e The top-secret PRISM program allows the U.S. intelligence community to gain access from nine Internet companies to a wide range of digital information, including e-mails and stored data, on foreign targets operating outside the United States. The program is court-approved but does not require individual warrants. Instead, it operates under a broader authorization from federal judges who oversee the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Some documents describing the program were first released by The Washington Post on June 6. The newly released documents below give additional details about how the program operates, including the levels of review and supervisory control at the NSA and FBI. The documents also show how the program interacts with the Internet companies. These slides, annotated by The Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and certain portions are redacted.\n\nThis presentation lists Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple as being the sources of data for PRISM.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/prism-affected.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nJoshua Brustein, [writing for Bloomberg Businessweek]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-07/the-companies-lines-on-prism\" %}}), has collected statements from all of the companies named in the leaked NSA documents.\n\n\u003e In a series of terse statement *(sic)*, all the companies named in the reports about NSA’s Internet snooping program, Prism, have denied involvement. All these companies have been compelled to share personal data with the government at some time, which they tacitly acknowledge by saying they only do so after careful consideration and court orders. “Direct access” to servers, though, is a bridge too far, they say \\[…\\].\n\nDara Kerr, [writing for CNET]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57610342-83/apple-google-microsoft-unite-against-nsa-spying-program/\" %}}), says that “The tech giants \\[Apple, Google, Microsoft\\], along with Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL, call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to substantially reform the US government’s mass surveillance practices.”\n\n\u003e Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL penned a letter ([pdf]({{% wayback \"http://www.scribd.com/doc/180596438/USA-Freedom-Act-Letter-10-31-13-pdf\" %}})) to the lead members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday urging the lawmakers to substantially reform the NSA surveillance practices. The companies also asked for additional oversight and accountability mechanisms for the spying programs.\n\u003e\n\u003e “Transparency is a critical first step to an informed public debate, but it is clear that more needs to be done,” the letter reads. “We urge the Administration to work with Congress in addressing these critical reforms that would provide much needed transparency and help rebuild the trust of Internet users around the world.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e That document leak opened the public’s eyes to the government’s collection of data on US residents through both cellular records and metadata from Internet companies. Since Snowden’s original leak, thousands more documents have surfaced. The NSA and the Obama administration have maintained that the surveillance program was carried out to protect Americans and track down foreign terrorists.\n\nThe piece continues, showing precisely how good intentions mean nothing in the real world.\n\n\u003e The letter sent by the tech companies “applauds” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) who recently sponsored a bill called the USA Freedom Act. This bill has the goal of “ending eavesdropping, dragnet collection, and online monitoring” by the NSA and other government agencies.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sensenbrenner is considered one of the architects of the Patriot Act, which the NSA often cites as a legal justification for its surveillance activities. However, Sensenbrenner is adamant that mass government spying wasn’t the intention of the Patriot Act.\n\u003e\n\u003e “We have to make a balance between security and civil liberties,” Sensenbrenner told the Associated Press in an interview last week. “And the reason the intelligence community has gotten itself into such trouble is they apparently do not see why civil liberties have got to be protected.”\n\n\n## Isn’t that against the law?\n\nYou’ve asked a very complex question.\n\nIf you read up on FISA and its various amendments, it is very clear that for the American government to get information from American companies on American soil, they have to provide probable cause and get a warrant from a judge.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/fisa@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nWhat they’ve done is not break the law, but rather *go around it*. *The Guardian* has an excellent presentation entitled [“NSA Files: Decoded. What the revelations mean for you.”]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\" %}}) which does a terrific job explaining everything. I would encourage you to take some time learning from it.\n\n\u003e Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.\n\nWhat the NSA has done is partner with [GCHQ]({{% wayback \"http://www.gchq.gov.uk\" %}}) (Britain’s equivalent agency) to tap the private fiber-optic cables that transfer digital data from continent to continent.\n\nInstead of the American government getting information from American companies on American soil, they’re getting it on *British soil* — which negates all of the oversight protections that American citizens expect.\n\nThe British parliament was [very aware of the power they had over their own people]({{% wayback \"http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/mps-admit-they-knew-how-powerful-gchq-had-become-1-3181385\" %}}), and colluded with the NSA to dodge American law. While it’s not *technically* a violation of FISA (which itself is being contested as unconstitutional), it is *absolutely* a violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u003e “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n\nThe ACLU published a piece entitled [“Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act”]({{% wayback \"https://www.aclu.org/national-security/surveillance-under-usa-patriot-act\" %}}) which explains how the Patriot Act violates our Constitutional rights.\n\nWith regard to “Expanded access to personal records held by third parties”:\n\n\u003e Section 215 of the Patriot Act violates the Constitution in several ways. It:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the Fourth Amendment by failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nWith regard to “secret searches”:\n\n\u003e The Patriot Act, however, unconstitutionally amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed. This means that the government can enter a house, apartment or office with a search warrant when the occupants are away, search through their property, take photographs, and in some cases even seize property - and not tell them until later.\n\u003e\n\u003e Notice is a crucial check on the government’s power because it forces the authorities to operate in the open, and allows the subject of searches to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. For example, it allows them to point out irregularities in a warrant, such as the fact that the police are at the wrong address, or that the scope of the warrant is being exceeded (for example, by rifling through dresser drawers in a search for a stolen car).\n\nWith regard to “Expansion of the intelligence exception in wiretap law”:\n\n\u003e A 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) created an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for probable cause when the purpose of a wiretap or search was to gather foreign intelligence. The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\n\nWith regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\n\n\u003e Under the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Web addresses are rich and revealing content. The URLs or “addresses” of the Web pages we read are not really addresses, they are the titles of documents that we download from the Internet. When we “visit” a Web page what we are really doing is downloading that page from the Internet onto our computer, where it is displayed. \\[…\\] That is much richer information than a simple list of the people we have communicated with; it is intimate information that reveals who we are and what we are thinking about - much more like the content of a phone call than the number dialed. After all, it is often said that reading is a “conversation” with the author.\n\nIn order for a federal law to be recognized as unconstitutional, a court case needs to go before the U.S. Supreme Court to be decided. Not many court cases against a federal agency have been able to make it that far, but on occasion, [something gets caught]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#interactive/7\" %}}).\n\n\u003e In January 2009, the FISA court was notified that the NSA had been querying business records metadata “in a manner that appear\\[ed\\] to the Court to be directly contrary” to the court’s order allowing it to so. In response, the FISA court ordered the government to explain itself. These documents detail this exchange as the NSA struggled to understand the business records program and ensure compliance.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e “The court is exceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its order in this matter and, while the court will not direct that specific officials of the executive branch provide sworn declarations in response to this order, the court expects that the declarants will be officials of sufficient stature that they have the authority to speak on behalf of the executive branch.”\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e — {{\u003c person name=\"Reggie Walton\" \u003e}}\n\nUsing [this interactive diagram]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#interactive/14\" %}}), you can see which laws, amendments and executive orders have enabled the NSA to operate as it currently does.\n\n\n## So, what are Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple doing about this?\n\nFirst of all, it needs to be clear that **they never knowingly gave this kind of information to the NSA**. The NSA colluded with the GCHQ to subvert American law by directly tapping the fiber optic cables that sends data between continents.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/gchq-building@2x.jpg\" figure=\"GCHQ offices in England, UK\"\u003e}}\n\nBarton Gellman, Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson, [writing for The Washington Post]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/\" %}}), explain “How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data” (emphasis **mine**).\n\n\u003e Immediately after the story posted online, a reporter asked NSA Director Keith B. Alexander about it at a cybersecurity event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Neither the reporter nor Alexander had read the story yet.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e General, we’re getting some news that’s crossing right now being reported in The Washington Post that there are new Snowden allegations that say the NSA broke into Yahoo and Google’s databases worldwide, that they infiltrated these databases?\n\u003e\n\u003e Alexander replied:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e That’s never happened. \\[…\\] This is not the NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that. And so I don’t know what the report is, but I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\n\u003e\n\u003e The story did not say the NSA breaks into “servers” or “databases.” It said the agency, working with its British counterpart, **intercepts communications that run on private circuits between the fortress-like data centers that each company operates on multiple continents**.\n\u003e\n\u003e The distinction is between “data at rest” and “data on the fly.” The NSA and GCHQ do not break into user accounts that are stored on Yahoo and Google computers. **They intercept the information as it travels over fiber optic cables from one data center to another**. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e The two companies do not entrust their data center communications to the “public internet,” which is comparable to an international highway system that anyone can use. **Instead, they link their data centers with thousands of miles of privately owned or privately leased fiber optic cable – in effect, a system of private highways.** When Google and Yahoo have to share a stretch of road with the public internet, they take other precautions to keep their traffic secure. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Our Wednesday story noted that the NSA is governed by fewer rules and less oversight when it does its intelligence collection outside U.S. territory:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e Intercepting communications overseas has clear advantages for the NSA, with looser restrictions and less oversight. **NSA documents about the effort refer directly to “full take,” “bulk access” and “high volume” operations on Yahoo and Google networks.** Such large-scale collection of Internet content would be illegal in the United States, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA is allowed to presume that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner.\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e Outside U.S. territory, statutory restrictions on surveillance seldom apply and the FISC has no jurisdiction. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has acknowledged that **Congress conducts little oversight of intelligence-gathering under the presidential authority of Executive Order 12333, which defines the basic powers and responsibilities of the intelligence agencies**.\n\n([EO 12333]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333\" %}}) was signed by {{\u003c person name=\"Ronald Reagan\" \u003e}}.

Bush.)\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Brandon Downey\" \u003e}}, a security engineer at Google, [had this to say]({{% wayback \"https://plus.google.com/108799184931623330498/posts/SfYy8xbDWGG\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Fuck these guys.\n\u003e\n\u003e I’ve spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google’s users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e It makes me sad because I believe in America.\n\u003e\n\u003e Not in that flag-waving bullshit we’ve-got-our-big-trucks-and-bigger-tanks sort of way, but in the way that you can looked a good friend who has a lot of flaws, but every time you meet him, you think, “That guy still has some good ideas going on”.\n\u003e\n\u003e But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google — one of the greatest things to arise from the internet — seeing this, well, it’s just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Mike Hearn\" \u003e}}, another security engineer at Google, [had this to say]({{% wayback \"https://plus.google.com/+MikeHearn/posts/LW1DXJ2BK8k\" %}}):\n\n\u003e I now join him in issuing a giant Fuck You to the people who made these slides. I am not American, I am a Brit, but it’s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.\n\u003e\n\u003e We designed this system to keep criminals out. There’s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we’ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.\n\u003e\n\u003e Unfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\n\nLater, in the comments of his post, he explains the following:\n\n\u003e Encryption was being worked on prior to Snowden but it didn’t seem like a high priority because there was no evidence it would achieve anything useful, and it cost a lot of resources. Once it became clear how badly compromised the fiber paths were, there was a crash effort to encrypt everything.\n\nSean Gallagher, [writing for Ars Technica]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/googlers-say-f-you-to-nsa-company-encrypts-internal-network/\" %}}), says that “Googlers say ‘F\\*\\*\\* you’ to NSA, company encrypts internal network”.\n\n\u003e Google has started to encrypt its traffic between its data centers, effectively halting the broad surveillance of its inner workings by the joint National Security Agency-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR. The move turns off a giant source of information to the two agencies, which at one point accounted for nearly a third of the NSA’s daily data intake for its primary intelligence analysis database—at least for now.\n\u003e\n\u003e As of 2012, the NSA developed “defeat fingerprints” to scan the server-to-server communications that powered Google Adwords, Blogger, the BigTable database that powers Google Drive and other applications, and the TeraGoogle search index interface. These fingerprints allowed the NSA to scan Google internal traffic and identify elements associated with the usage of specific individuals or for searches and other behavior around a particular subject of interest (like, say, “pressure cooker bomb”). \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e A second set of NSA tools, called Serendipity, gave the agency the ability to target specific Google accounts for monitoring as they accessed service, including:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Chrome synchronization, including bookmark sync to the cloud\n\u003e * “Talkgadget,” the Google Talk component of Gmail\n\u003e * The now-defunct iGoogle personalized pages\n\u003e * Google searches\n\u003e * Picasa photo sharing\n\u003e * YouTube \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e For Yahoo, the NSA had developed another set of hooks, fully accessing its internal mail protocols as well as its Messenger instant messaging service, advertising tracker, and “Web beacons” used to track whether users had opened HTML-formatted emails. And the agency had to respond to a flood of unwanted data from these sources by instituting blocks—mostly to deal with Yahoo’s periodic movement of entire user mailboxes.\n\nChris Baraniuk, [writing for Wired]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/we-still-dont-encrypt-server-to-server-data-admits-microsoft/\" %}}), says that Microsoft still doesn’t encrypt server-to-server data.\n\n\u003e A senior Microsoft executive has told a European parliamentary committee that the company does not encrypt its server-to-server data communications.\n\u003e\n\u003e Dorothee Belz, EMEA VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, made the remark when answering a question from Claude Moraes, MEP, during a meeting at the European Parliament on Monday.\n\u003e\n\u003e “Generally, what I can say today is server-to-server transportation is generally not encrypted,” she said. “This is why we are currently reviewing our security system.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s just one of several leaks by former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden that has concerned the EU’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) in a series of parliamentary hearings.\n\u003e\n\u003e Prior to taking questions from MEPs, Belz, who appeared alongside executives from Google and Facebook, reiterated earlier statements from Microsoft by stressing that the company did not openly provide “direct access” to its servers. However, her later admission that the firm has as yet failed to establish server-to-server encryption has raised fears among many within digital liberties groups that a significant breach of privacy could still be perpetrated.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sam Smith, a technologist at Privacy International, said the unencrypted data could hypothetically relate to any of Microsoft’s cloud services, from Hotmail and Outlook.com email accounts to Xbox Live, Office 365, and SkyDrive cloud storage.\n\n\n## What now?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/hands-off-my-metadata@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n[The debate Snowden wanted is happening]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/6\" %}}). That in itself is a major achievement.\n\n\u003e Public opinion is polarized over surveillance, but polls show a jump in concern over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations. A [Pew poll at the end of July]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/poll-nsa-surveillance-privacy-pew\" %}}) found that for the first time in a decade, the majority of Americans are more concerned about the government infringing on their civil liberties than about a potential terrorist attack. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e According to a recent study, the majority of Americans believe that preserving the rights of US citizens is more important than preventing terrorist attacks. Since the NSA revelations, Americans have become more opposed to government surveillance that infringes on civil liberties.\n\nPeople are turning to the court system more and more.\n\n\u003e In the end, it may be through the courts rather than Congress that genuine reform may come. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched lawsuits that have led to disclosure of hundreds of pages of Fisa *(sic)* rulings on Section 215. GCHQ and NSA surveillance is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights from Big Brother Watch, English PEN and Open Rights Group.\n\u003e\n\u003e Silicon Valley is also taking action through the courts. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, facing a backlash from their users in the US and overseas over mass surveillance, are fighting to be allowed to be more transparent about their dealings with the intelligence agencies. These companies, along with Facebook, Apple and AOL have also written to the Senate intelligence committee demanding reform.\n\nWith as much hate and backbiting I’ve seen among American citizens and Congressional members since 2000, something strange has happened around this issue.\n\n\u003e There are now several major pieces of legislation going through Congress that would introduce at least some reform of the NSA. Among those, the one backed by Feinstein and passed by her committee is the least radical, offering proposals for greater transparency but basically maintaining the status quo. The bulk collection of Americans’ phone call data would be enshrined in US law.\n\u003e\n\u003e More far-reaching is the proposed Intelligence Oversight and Reform Act, with bipartisan support from senators Wyden, Udall, Richard Blumenthal and Rand Paul. It would ban the collection of internet communication data; close loopholes that allow snooping on Americans without a warrant; reform the Fisa court; and provide some protection for companies faced with handing over data to the NSA.\n\n\n## What about Edward Snowden?\n\nAfter leaving Hawai’i and his job as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong before winding up in Moscow, where Russian President {{\u003c person name=\"Vladimir Putin\" \u003e}} granted him temporary asylum and protection from the U.S. government.\n\nHe most certainly has a rough road ahead of him. There’s no way you can piss-off the U.S. government as badly as he has and plan to remain free forever. Then again, they also said that about Bobby Fischer.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\" \u003e}} once said:\n\n\u003e “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.”\n\nI, for one, consider Edward Snowden a hero and a patriot to the highest degree.\n\n\n## Update (2013–12–09)\n\nAol, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! have all gotten together and put forward this new initiative: [ReformGovernmentSurviellance.com]({{% wayback \"http://reformgovernmentsurviellance.com\" %}}).\n\nI’m disappointed that Apple isn’t on this list.\n"},
