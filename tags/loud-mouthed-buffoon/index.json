        "plain":"Wayne Gretzky is often credited as being the single greatest hockey player of all time. It is said that his father, Walter Gretzky, taught him the most important thing to learn in hockey:\n “Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”\n This quote in particular is one that Steve Jobs has brought up on numerous occasions, and is far more revealing about Apple’s internal culture than I think most of us realize. It is certainly the most salient explanation for Apple’s intense focus at the intersection of technology and liberal arts.\n  Mobile Over the past couple of years, I’ve started paying an increasing amount of attention to Apple and it’s competition — mostly in the mobile space. Before 2008 when I bought my first iPhone, I really couldn’t have cared less about mobile. I’d had a couple of feature phones, then moved up to a BlackBerry Pearl in 2006. When Steve Jobs got up on stage at the Moscone Center in January 2007 and introduced “[…] an iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… these are NOT three separate devices!” I was stunned. I’d heard the rumors about an alleged phone from Apple, but this thing was simply astounding! Over the next 6 months, the blogosphere worked itself into an absolute frenzy over the iPhone. Ultimately, the iPhone has gone on to be a raging success — raking in two-thirds of all of the profits in the entire mobile industry.\nHardware and software Since Apple makes both the hardware and the software for all of their products, when you buy an iPhone (or iPod, or iPad, or Mac) you know that the hardware and software work together seamlessly. With the exception of HP/Palm ([up until recently](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=touchpad discontinued) and RIM, Apple is the only company that does this. Even Google’s Nexus line of phones is actually made by third-party handset makers (HTC for the Nexus One and Samsung for the Nexus S). In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\nHardware Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  BlackBerry 8800 Research In Motion     Q Motorola     E70 Nokia     Excalibur HTC     Touch HTC     Treo 755p Palm     Treo 700wx Palm    Software Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  Palm OS 5 PalmSoft     Windows Mobile 6 Microsoft     Symbian OS Nokia     Android Google    Queue the industry scramble People in the mobile industry knew this was going to be big, huge, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next iPhone-killer. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first touchphones started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had all of the same features, so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\nThere is no tablet market — only an iPad market Verne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of The New York Times note:\n “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n Here’s what John Gruber from Daring Fireball had to say:\n “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n And Marco Arment:\n \u0026ldquo;There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t nothing, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\u0026rdquo;\n Others are saying the same thing. But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\nIt’s the ecosystem, stupid! The fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n  Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n  Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n  The iTunes Store has over 18 million songs; thousands of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 virus-free apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n  iTunes Home Sharing allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n  AirPlay (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an AirPort Express or support the AirPlay protocol.\n  You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an Apple TV also using AirPlay.\n  You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n  Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n  Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n  Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n  Compare all of this to, say, Android.\n  First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n  Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n  There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has Google Music, but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n  Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe”, “Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says”, “Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them”, and “Warning: Fake games in the Market today”.\n  There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n  There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n  There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n  What Android cottage industry?\n  Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n  Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a small subset of devices based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n  Apple’s Strategy Apple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about the digital hub dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their Rip, Mix, Burn campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n iTunes (2001) Mac OS X (2001) Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001) iPod (2001) Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002) iTunes Music Store (2003) AirPort Express (2004) iLife (2004) Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005) Apple TV (2007) iPhone (2007) iPhone Music Store (2007) iPhone App Store (2008) iPad (2010) iCloud (2011)  All of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\nSkating to where the puck has been Right now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. Everyone.\n  Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n  Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n  Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n  Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n  As technophiliacs, it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. For example, Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices. Really Samsung? In \u0026ldquo;Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong\u0026rdquo;, Zach Epstein writes:\n \u0026ldquo;Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy. The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\u0026rdquo;\n These products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\nSkating to where the puck is going to be Robert S. Andersen recently tweeted:\n Apple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is delightful. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip:\n Harriet: I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\nMatt: That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\nHarriet: What did I do wrong?\nMatt: You asked for the laugh.\nHarriet: What did I do at the table read?\nMatt: You asked for the butter.\n If you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\nUpdate: HP Envy (2011–11–16 ) If I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new HP Envy.\n  I feel like I’ve seen this somewhere before…\nUpdate: Fun with numbers! (2011–11–24 ) In his piece entitled “Fun With Numbers”, John Gruber from Daring Fireball analyzes an NPD Group report about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., real sales numbers to consumers, not the fake we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them numbers).\n That’s one way to put it. Another way is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely considered an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, none of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011.

PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n He finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n ",

In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\n\n## Hardware\n\nHere’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n\n{{\u003cimage-grid\u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/blackberry-8800.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/RIM_BlackBerry_8800/4505-6452_7-32329098.html\"\n        title=\"BlackBerry 8800\"\n        subtitle=\"Research In Motion\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/moto-q.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Motorola_Q_Sprint/4505-6452_7-32327377.html\"\n        title=\"Q\"\n        subtitle=\"Motorola\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nokia-e70.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Nokia_E70/4505-6452_7-32381755.html\"\n        title=\"E70\"\n        subtitle=\"Nokia\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/htc-excalibur.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/t-mobile-dash-aka/4505-6452_7-32088045.html\"\n        title=\"Excalibur\"\n        subtitle=\"HTC\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/htc-touch.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/htc-touch-unlocked/4505-6452_7-32465595.html\"\n        title=\"Touch\"\n        subtitle=\"HTC\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-treo-755p.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smart-phones/palm-treo-755p-sprint/4505-6452_7-32434432.html\"\n        title=\"Treo 755p\"\n        subtitle=\"Palm\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-treo-700wx.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/palm-treo-700wx-black/4505-6452_7-32058773.html\"\n        title=\"Treo 700wx\"\n        subtitle=\"Palm\"\n    \u003e}}\n{{\u003c/image-grid\u003e}}\n\n## Software\n\nHere’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n\n{{\u003cimage-grid\u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-os.jpg\"\n        title=\"Palm OS 5\"\n        subtitle=\"PalmSoft\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-mobile.jpg\"\n        title=\"Windows Mobile 6\"\n        subtitle=\"Microsoft\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/symbian.jpg\"\n        title=\"Symbian OS\"\n        subtitle=\"Nokia\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/android2.jpg\"\n        title=\"Android\"\n        subtitle=\"Google\"\n    \u003e}}\n{{\u003c/image-grid\u003e}}\n\n\n## Queue the industry scramble\n\nPeople in the mobile industry knew this was going to be ~~big~~, ~~huge~~, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next *iPhone-killer*. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first *touchphones* started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had [all of the same features]({{% wayback \"http://www.marco.org/2010/02/09/feature-checklist-dysfunction\" %}}), so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\n\n## There is no tablet market — only an iPad market\n\nVerne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of [The New York Times note]({{% wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/as-pcs-wane-companies-look-to-tablets.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n\nHere’s what John Gruber from [Daring Fireball had to say]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/ipad_dominance\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n\nAnd [Marco Arment]({{% wayback \"http://www.marco.org/2010/12/31/there-really-isnt-much-of-a-tablet-market\" %}}):\n\n\u003e \"There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t *nothing*, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\"\n\n[Others]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20110620/consumers-dont-want-tablets-they-want-ipads/\" %}}) [are]({{% wayback \"http://seekingalpha.com/article/289447-there-is-no-tablet-market-only-an-ipad-market\" %}}) [saying]({{% wayback \"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/tablet-computers\" %}}) [the]({{% wayback \"http://technologizer.com/2011/08/17/more-evidence-that-theres-no-tablet-market/\" %}}) [same]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/ipad_dominance\" %}}) [thing]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}}). But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\n\n## It’s the ecosystem, stupid!\n\nThe fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I [wrote a couple of weeks ago](/2011/08/21/comparing-the-hp-touchpad-to-the-ipad-2/), I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\n\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n\n* Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n\n* Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n\n* The iTunes Store has [over 18 million songs]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/\" %}}); [thousands]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/itunes.html\" %}}) of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 *virus-free* apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n\n* [iTunes Home Sharing]({{% wayback \"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3819\" %}}) allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n\n* [AirPlay]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/\" %}}) (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an [AirPort Express]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/\" %}}) or support the AirPlay protocol.\n\n* You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an [Apple TV]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/appletv/\" %}}) also using [AirPlay]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/appletv/#remote\" %}}).\n\n* You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n\n* Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n\n* Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n\n* Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on [all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" %}}) (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n\nCompare all of this to, say, Android.\n\n* First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n\n* Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n\n* There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has [Google Music]({{% wayback \"http://music.google.com\" %}}), but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n\n* Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “[Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe]({{% wayback \"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/08/android-malware-explodes-ios-remains-safe/all/1\" %}})”, “[Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/24/android-targeted-malware-jumps-76-in-q2-mcafee-says/\" %}})”, “[Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them]({{% wayback \"http://www.technobuffalo.com/companies/google/android/why-android-viruses-are-growing-and-how-to-stop-them/\" %}})”, and “[Warning: Fake games in the Market today]({{% wayback \"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kjywq/warning_fake_games_in_the_market_today/\" %}})”.\n\n* There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n\n* There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n\n* There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n\n* What Android cottage industry?\n\n* Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n\n* Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a [small subset of devices]({{% wayback \"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient\" %}}) based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n\n## Apple’s Strategy\n\nApple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about *the digital hub* dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their [Rip, Mix, Burn]({{% wayback \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECN4ZE9-Mo\" %}}) campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n\n1. iTunes (2001)\n2. Mac OS X (2001)\n3. Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001)\n4. iPod (2001)\n5. Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002)\n6. iTunes Music Store (2003)\n7. AirPort Express (2004)\n8. iLife (2004)\n9. Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005)\n10. Apple TV (2007)\n11. iPhone (2007)\n12. iPhone Music Store (2007)\n13. iPhone App Store (2008)\n14. iPad (2010)\n15. iCloud (2011)\n\nAll of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\n\n## Skating to where the puck has been\n\nRight now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. *Everyone.*\n\n* Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n\n* Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n\n* Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n\n* Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n\nAs [technophiliacs]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Technophilia\" %}}), it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to *throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.* For example, [Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/109241074429603840\" %}}). Really Samsung? In \"[Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}})\", Zach Epstein writes:\n\n\u003e \"Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: *slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy.* The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\"\n\nThese products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\n\n## Skating to where the puck is going to be\n\nRobert S. Andersen recently [tweeted]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/rsa/status/106977599183527936\" %}}):\n\n{{\u003c tweet 106977599183527936 \u003e}}\n\nApple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is *delightful*. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\n\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, [Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip\" %}}):\n\n\u003e **Harriet:** I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\n\u003e\n\u003e **Matt:** That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do wrong?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the laugh.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do at the table read?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the butter.\n\nIf you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\n\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\n\n## Update: HP Envy ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–16\"\u003e}})\n\nIf I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new [HP Envy]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/16/2564285/hp-envy-15-and-17-press-photos\" %}}).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hp-envy.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nI feel like I’ve [seen this somewhere before]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/\" %}})…\n\n## Update: Fun with numbers! ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–24\"\u003e}})\n\nIn his piece entitled “[Fun With Numbers]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers\" %}})”, John Gruber from *Daring Fireball* analyzes an [NPD Group report]({{% wayback \"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b\" %}}) about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., *real* sales numbers to consumers, not the fake *we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them* numbers).\n\n\u003e That’s one way to put it. [Another way]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/139517109439959040\" %}}) is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely *considered* an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, *none* of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011. \\[…\\] PC manufacturers are *not* dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem — hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals — are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n\nHe finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n\n\u003e The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n"},

        "plain":"I currently own and love my iPad 2, but with HP slashing the prices on the new TouchPads this weekend, I decided to pick one up after calling around and finding some at my local Best Buy.   Preface I feel that I should start by saying that I’m an Apple guy; or more specifically that I’ve always been an Apple guy. I was converted to the Mac platform back in the early 90’s when my Junior High school’s library got a new shipment of Apple Macintosh LC IIs. I’ve never really looked back.\nThat said, this certainly isn’t a blind love for Apple. Over the years, Apple has earned my trust by providing high-quality products, software and support that puts the consumer first. That doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ve liked every single decicion they’ve made, but all-in-all I have Apple’s back because I believe that Apple has mine.\nLet’s look at the competition:\n  RIM: RIM is dead. Sell your stock.\n  Microsoft: Irrelevant in this day and age.\n  Google:\n  They’d screw me in a second if they could sell more data about me to advertisers.\n  Google values engineering above all else. Unfortunately for Google, Design is more important than Engineering.\n  Andy Rubin has as much dumb stuff come out of his mouth as Steve Ballmer.\n  Google recently kicked off a whine-fest because they lost a patent auction.\n    Palm: CEO was a high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod. Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n  Piqued Interest I have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s Windows CE, palm-sized PC, PocketPC, Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition, Windows Mobile, Windows Embedded Handheld, Windows Phone 7 Series, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called The Paradox of Choice (TED video) (Wikipedia summary). The short version is that while people like Steve Ballmer and Andy Rubin are all touting how wonderful it is to have a plethora of devices available, it’s actually harmful to the customer experience.\nSo when Palm/HP announced the TouchPad, I was intrigued. I’d always thought that Palm’s webOS was a clear stand-out among mobile OSs, but the faulty Pre hardware and a poor at-launch partner (Sprint), and terrible marketing all worked in concert to kill Palm’s chances of making a dent in the marketplace. Palm also was in the poor position of needing a serious influx of cash if they were to continue operating. That kind of split focus is never good for a company.\nSeeing some gorgeous screenshots of the OS and devices on Sebastiaan de With’s blog pretty much sealed the deal for me: I was a webOS fan. Unfortunately for Palm/HP, there was no way I was going to spend money on a TouchPad when I could get an iPad.\n  Comparing the TouchPad and the iPad 2 I ordered my iPad 2 at the end of July, so I’ve only had my iPad 2 for about 3 weeks. I also have an iPhone 4, so picking up and using an iPad was effortless. Because of this, the iPad has set an awfully high bar in my mind.\nAfter spending a little less than 24 hours with my new 32GB HP TouchPad, here are my thoughts:\nPros   Palm/HP definitely got the packaging right. It’s the most Apple-like experience for any non-Apple product I’ve ever seen.\n  webOS is gorgeous, with an emphasis on black/charcoal colors, the Prelude system font, and high-quality iconography derived from the circle shape (Palm owns the circle). If you believe (as I do) that a software environment should look as good as it works, webOS is fantastic.\n  The TouchPad hardware is nice to the eyes and the touch. It has a sturdy (although somewhat plastic-y) feel to it.\n  Neither Netflix nor Hulu are filtering the TouchPad’s user-agent string. Hulu seems to maintain a black list for devices (Hulu has to pro-actively block devices), while Netflix seems to maintain a white list for devices (Netflix has to pro-actively allow devices). While I can watch Hulu content on my TouchPad (which comes with Flash), I can’t watch Netflix content (which requires Silverlight).\n  The bezel/cards UI is awesome.\n  Built-in support for several third-party accounts, including Skype and Dropbox. While iOS (and Mac OS X Lion) also has this, webOS’s integration seems to go a lot deeper — specifically in being able to do a decent job of merging contacts together across the various services.\n  The Facebook app (developed by Palm) beats the pants off of the phone-only iOS Facebook app. The closest competitor available for the iPad is an app called MyPad+.\n  The Last.fm app is also designed for the TouchPad, easily beating the phone-only iOS Last.fm app.\n  The photo app has built-in support for Facebook photos and videos built right in.\n  The on-screen keyboard has digits as part of its first screen. You don’t need to tap shift to get to them.\n  Cons   It’s a lot heavier than my iPad 2.\n  The screen and iPhone 3G-ish style back attract fingerprints like its their job.\n  The UI doesn’t track finger movements as quickly as iOS, so the touch/scroll responsiveness feels laggy compared to the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.\n  Actually, the whole OS is a bit laggy. It’s as if it takes a moment to “spin-up” after I launch an application or switch from one screen to another.\n  The TouchPad uses a non-standard Mini-USB cable, so my cache of leftover cables from my BlackBerry Pearl days are still as useless to me as they’ve been since I upgraded to the iPhone.\n  It doesn’t seem to charge when connected to my computer, so I need to disconnect it, climb down underneath my desk, and plug it in to get it to charge.\n  Ever heard of BeatsAudio? It’s the technology that powers the Beats by Dre headphone that are so freaking awesome. Yeah, not feeling it here. The iPad 2 speakers are better.\n  The app selection is downright awful. All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Twitter, Instapaper, Flipboard are nowhere to be found on the HP App Catalog.\n  While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n  Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is much slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the Browserscope test suite for the past couple of hours and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n  The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see Mail). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n  Syncing sucks. Even with the HP Play software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n  Conclusion All-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n  I think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer (early 2011 MacBook Pro), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire store catalog.\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s Nintendo DSs when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of New Super Mario Bros. and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\nEpilogue: Side-by-side Photos In this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n  Here they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n  Here is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n  (Photo credits: First photo by HP/Palm. Second and third photos by Sebastiaan de With. Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\nUpdate: Micro-USB (2011–08–25 ) Thanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size du jour called Micro USB. The TouchPad uses the Micro-B flavor, which is why my Mini USB cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\nUpdate: Hulu (2011–08–25 ) Over the past couple of days, Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist. Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n  Update: Preware (2011–08–25 ) Last night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered Preware. Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like Cydia and Rock Your Phone for jailbroken iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually quite OK with this community).\n  As part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \u0026ldquo;Got a slow HP TouchPad? Here are 3 easy ways to speed it up.\u0026rdquo; The first thing you learn is that webOS does a ton of logging in the background.

I had wondered why downloads seemed so slow on the TouchPad compared to my iOS devices. As it turns out, webOS throttles download speeds down to 64 kbps.

[Andy Rubin](https://twitter.com/Arubin/status/27808662429) has as much dumb stuff come out of his mouth as [Steve Ballmer]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2007/04/ballmer-says-iphone-has-no-chance-to-gain-significant-market-share.ars\" %}}).\n\n    4. Google recently kicked off a [whine-fest]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20110803/microsoft-pr-ninja-strikes-back-at-google-patent-whine-with-email-jujitsu/\" %}}) because they lost a patent auction.\n\n* **Palm:** CEO was a [high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jon_Rubinstein\" %}}). Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n\n## Piqued Interest\n\nI have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s ~~Windows CE~~, ~~palm-sized PC~~, ~~PocketPC~~, ~~Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition~~, ~~Windows Mobile~~, ~~Windows Embedded Handheld~~, ~~Windows Phone 7 Series~~, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called [The Paradox of Choice (TED video)]({{% wayback \"http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html\" %}}) ([Wikipedia summary]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less\" %}})). The short version is that while people like Steve Ballmer and Andy Rubin are all touting how wonderful it is to have a plethora of devices available, it’s actually harmful to the customer experience.\n\nSo when Palm/HP announced the TouchPad, I was intrigued. I’d always thought that Palm’s webOS was a clear stand-out among mobile OSs, but the [faulty Pre hardware]({{% wayback \"http://www.precentral.net/do-you-have-palm-pre-hardware-issues\" %}}) and a poor at-launch partner (Sprint), and [terrible marketing]({{% wayback \"http://youtu.be/iIknaMyJhvw\" %}}) all worked in concert to kill Palm’s chances of making a dent in the marketplace. Palm also was in the poor position of needing a serious influx of cash if they were to continue operating. That kind of split focus is never good for a company.\n\nSeeing some gorgeous screenshots of the OS and devices on [Sebastiaan de With’s blog]({{% wayback \"http://blog.cocoia.com/2011/hp-webos-event-roundup/\" %}}) pretty much sealed the deal for me: I was a webOS fan. Unfortunately for Palm/HP, there was no way I was going to spend money on a TouchPad when I could get an iPad.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Grabber.png\"\u003e}}\n\n## Comparing the TouchPad and the iPad 2\n\nI ordered my iPad 2 at the end of July, so I’ve only had my iPad 2 for about 3 weeks. I also have an iPhone 4, so picking up and using an iPad was effortless. Because of this, the iPad has set an awfully high bar in my mind.\n\nAfter spending a little less than 24 hours with my new 32GB HP TouchPad, here are my thoughts:\n\n### Pros\n\n* Palm/HP definitely got the packaging right. It’s the most Apple-like experience for any non-Apple product I’ve ever seen.\n\n* webOS is gorgeous, with an emphasis on black/charcoal colors, the [Prelude system font]({{% wayback \"http://www.fontbureau.com/blog/palm-pre-system-fonts/\" %}}), and high-quality iconography derived from the circle shape ([Palm owns the circle]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/01/own-a-shape\" %}})). If you believe (as I do) that a software environment should look as good as it works, webOS is fantastic.\n\n* The TouchPad hardware is nice to the eyes and the touch. It has a sturdy (although somewhat plastic-y) feel to it.\n\n* Neither Netflix nor Hulu are filtering the TouchPad’s user-agent string. Hulu seems to maintain a black list for devices (Hulu has to pro-actively block devices), while Netflix seems to maintain a white list for devices (Netflix has to pro-actively allow devices). While I can watch Hulu content on my TouchPad (which comes with Flash), I can’t watch Netflix content (which requires Silverlight).\n\n* The bezel/cards UI is awesome.\n\n* Built-in support for several third-party accounts, including Skype and Dropbox. While iOS (and Mac OS X Lion) also has this, webOS’s integration seems to go a lot deeper — specifically in being able to do a decent job of merging contacts together across the various services.\n\n* The Facebook app (developed by Palm) beats the pants off of the phone-only iOS Facebook app. The closest competitor available for the iPad is an app called [MyPad+]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mypad-for-facebook-twitter/id413419662\" %}}).\n\n* The Last.fm app is also designed for the TouchPad, easily beating the phone-only iOS Last.fm app.\n\n* The photo app has built-in support for Facebook photos and videos built right in.\n\n* The on-screen keyboard has digits as part of its first screen. You don’t need to tap `shift` to get to them.\n\n### Cons\n\n* It’s a lot heavier than my iPad 2.\n\n* The screen and iPhone 3G-ish style back attract fingerprints like its their job.\n\n* The UI doesn’t track finger movements as quickly as iOS, so the touch/scroll responsiveness feels laggy compared to the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.\n\n* Actually, the whole OS is a bit laggy. It’s as if it takes a moment to “spin-up” after I launch an application or switch from one screen to another.\n\n* The TouchPad uses a non-standard Mini-USB cable, so my cache of leftover cables from my BlackBerry Pearl days are still as useless to me as they’ve been since I upgraded to the iPhone.\n\n* It doesn’t seem to charge when connected to my computer, so I need to disconnect it, climb down underneath my desk, and plug it in to get it to charge.\n\n* Ever heard of BeatsAudio? It’s the technology that powers the [Beats by Dre]({{% wayback \"http://beatsbydre.com\" %}}) headphone that are so freaking awesome. Yeah, not feeling it here. The iPad 2 speakers are better.\n\n* The app selection is downright awful. All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., [Netflix]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" %}}), [Hulu]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hulu-plus/id376510438\" %}}), [Twitter]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271\" %}}), [Instapaper]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208\" %}}), [Flipboard]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284\" %}}) are nowhere to be found on the [HP App Catalog]({{% wayback \"http://h41112.www4.hp.com/promo/webos/us/en/apps.html\" %}}).\n\n* While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n\n* Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is *much* slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the [Browserscope]({{% wayback \"http://browserscope.org\" %}}) test suite for the past couple of *hours* and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n\n* The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see [Mail]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/mail.html\" %}})). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n\n* Syncing sucks. Even with the [HP Play]({{% wayback \"http://hpplay.com\" %}}) software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TouchPad.png\"\u003e}}\n\nI think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer ([early 2011 MacBook Pro]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/stats/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\" %}})), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire ~~store~~ catalog.\n\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\n\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s [Nintendo DSs]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/ds\" %}}) when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of [New Super Mario Bros.]({{% wayback \"http://mario.nintendo.com\" %}}) and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\n\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\n\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\n\n## Epilogue: Side-by-side Photos\n\nIn this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6074944167_fdb72ba8c9_z.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\nHere they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6075483254_7426a943d9.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\nHere is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6074943945_f33605a463.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\n(Photo credits: First photo by [HP/Palm]({{% wayback \"http://hpwebos.com\" %}}).

Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\n\n## Update: Micro-USB ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nThanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size *du jour* called [Micro USB]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/USB#Mini_and_Micro_connectors\" %}}). The TouchPad uses the *Micro-B* flavor, which is why my *Mini USB* cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\n\n## Update: Hulu ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nOver the past couple of days, [Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist]({{% wayback \"http://www.precentral.net/hulu-finally-blocks-touchpad-owners-watching-videos\" %}}). Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080274516_8044d5f9ab.jpg\" alt=\"Hulu blocks HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\n## Update: Preware ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nLast night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered [Preware]({{% wayback \"http://preware.org\" %}}). Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like [Cydia]({{% wayback \"http://cydia.saurik.com/\" %}}) and [Rock Your Phone]({{% wayback \"http://rockyourphone.com\" %}}) for [jailbroken]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking\" %}}) iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually [quite OK]({{% wayback \"https://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=org.preware.docs\" %}}) with this community).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080468630_62f02c07f3.jpg\" alt=\"Preware\"\u003e}}\n\nAs part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \"[Got a slow HP TouchPad? Here are 3 easy ways to speed it up.]({{% wayback \"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/got-a-slow-hp-touchpad-here-are-3-easy-ways-to-speed-it-up/\" %}})\" The first thing you learn is that webOS does a ton of logging in the background. While potentially useful for debugging, it also uses up a tremendous amount of system resources. The article discusses how to turn it off by enabling developer mode, installing Preware, and then installing a homebrew package that disables the logging. Also, if you’re interested in squeezing even more juice out of your TouchPad, the article also discusses how to overclock your TouchPad from 1.2 GHz to 1.5 GHz.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6079931607_b4aeaf598f.jpg\" alt=\"Govnah\"\u003e}}\n\nAnother article by John Biehler entitled \"[How to install Preware onto your HP TouchPad on a Mac]({{% wayback \"http://johnbiehler.com/2011/07/22/how-to-install-preware-onto-your-hp-touchpad-on-a-mac/\" %}})\" suggests a few other packages you can install to improve the general responsiveness of webOS on the TouchPad. There are a few others you can install to just make life a little simpler as well. I chose to install the following patches:\n\n* Advanced Reset Options\n* Faster Card Animations HYPER Version\n* Increase Touch Sensitivity and Smoothness 10\n* Just Charge By Default\n* Muffle System Logging\n* Private Browsing\n* Remove Tap Ripple\n* Unthrottle Download Manager\n\nThat last one is interesting. I had wondered why downloads seemed so slow on the TouchPad compared to my iOS devices. As it turns out, webOS throttles download speeds down to 64 kbps. Applying the patch to unthrottle the download manager sped up my TouchPad downloads *dramatically*.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080468320_835506aa1e.jpg\" alt=\"Speed Test\"\u003e}}\n"},

IE 5.5 was released in 2000. IE6 was released in 2001. It’s now 2004. This spring will be three years since the last IE/Win update (not counting SP1). Let’s start putting up “your browser is outdated, please upgrade” messages for Internet Explorer 5.01 now, like we do for Netscape 4.x. This summer, let’s start displaying it for IE 5.5, and hopefully by this time next year a significant majority of people will at least be using IE6 — which will remove the need for the box model hack at the very least, maybe even more.\nPromote the use of Moz, Opera, or Safari in these messages, and the Standards-Compliant market share is sure to increase. The more of us who do it, the better the chances. It might not make Microsoft update their browser, but it might make them think about it if they lose enough market share.\n",
        "source":"\nDave Shea [recently asked]({{% wayback \"http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/01/05/standards/\" %}} \"Read the posting at Mezzoblue\"),\n\n\u003e Support the standards and nothing but the standards, regardless of whether or not browsers get them right?\n\u003e\n\u003e - or -\n\u003e\n\u003e Support what standards are available given today’s browser support, and kludge together markup/script/CSS hacks to overcome deficiencies in implementations?\n\nI am all-for the extensive use of web standards. Anyone who’s talked to me for more than two minutes when I’m in geek-mode, or who has read anything I’ve written on the subject knows this.\n\nI would prefer to serve my XHTML pages as application/xhtml+xml, use XHTML 1.0 Strict or 1.1, and have all of my CSS2 work without a hitch. Some people only design for the “trinity” (which I think is a bit of a misnomer — “triumvirate” would be better), being [Moz]({{% wayback \"http://www.mozilla.org\" %}}), [Opera]({{% wayback \"http://www.opera.com\" %}}), and [Safari]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/safari/\" %}}). These kinds of things are fine for them.\n\nUnfortunately, the real world — especially the world of business — requires sites to work as well on IE/Win as any other browser/platform, for no reason other than it hold the largest market share by far. Standards are fantastic, but standards purists are missing something. We couldn’t move on from using tables for layout until CSS was good enough to give us an alternative. Now CSS gives us that (better) alternative, but it’s not flawless — neither the support, nor the spec.\n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft is *the* driving force on the web. Not “driving” as in progressing, but “driving” as in “this is how it’s going to remain”. I could beat Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer senseless for not implementing `:hover` on all elements, or :focus on anything. It makes my job as a web designer that much more difficult.\n\nThe problem lies with this: Most web designers have a passion for the web, and what it all can be. We want it to move beyond the computer screen and into everything that it possibly can. I can now syndicate another website’s content on my site thanks to the power of the web. How cool is that? Microsoft, on the other hand, just wants control. They want power. They want money. They don’t care about the potential of the web. All of that “Your Potential. Our Passion.” is crap. Hey Microsoft! I wanna be a web designer when I grow up! Are you gonna help me? Where’s your passion now?!\n\nWe, as web designers, often say things along the lines of “IE has 90% of the market. We just have to design for them. Oh well.” I disagree with this. On the other hand, standards purists chanting “everyone must code perfectly right now” are wrong as well. We need to *transition* from the older methods to the newer methods, and that requires us to design standards-compliant sites using necessary (not gratuitous) CSS hacks to make it work.\n\nIE5 was released in 1999.
