And it will still help you out, but you need to understand your fundamentals. And no, it’s probably not going to work with your crappy $3/mo shared hosting plan.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2017/simplepie-neue-wordmark.png\" alt=\"The SimplePie wordmark (2017–)\" figure=\"The SimplePie wordmark (2017–)\" width=\"324\"\u003e}}\n\nThe first thing you’ll probably notice is the typeface change to [SF Pro Display, Medium]({{\u003c wayback \"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\" \u003e}})—the newest (2017) version of Apple’s San Francisco typeface that it uses throughout its products and on its website. The letter spacing is still pulled-in, but much less so than before.\n\nI also added the “ɴԍ” using the following glyphs: [LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL N]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0274/index.htm\" \u003e}}), and [CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER KOMI SJE]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/50d/index.htm\" \u003e}}). I made them about 45% smaller than the rest of the text, centered them horizontally, and left the same amount of space around the word “SimplePie”.\n\nSwitching to San Francisco Pro gives the logo a cleaner, more professional look while still maintaining the overall spirit of the original logo. It’s like looking at one of those _makeover_ shows on TV.\n\n## Coming Soon…\n\nI’m planning to do a complete reboot of the website when SimplePie NG ships its 1.0 release. While you will begin seeing the _Neue_ branding here and [on GitHub]({{\u003c wayback \"https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng\" \u003e}}), look for a freshly-redesigned website with the new feel when 1.0 gets tagged and released to Composer.\n"},
