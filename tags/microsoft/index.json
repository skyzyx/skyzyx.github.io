You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"f5IcBtaMR_k\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube.

You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/super-mario-galaxy.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMario Kart Wii (Sort of.

Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wii-u\"\u003eWii U\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"4e3qaPg_keg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whats-next-with-the-nx\"\u003eWhat’s next with the NX?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/nx.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"nintendo-account\"\u003eNintendo Account\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, figure out how to run a \u003cem\u003efreaking\u003c/em\u003e Nintendo account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of us live international lives.

I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/retro-fighters.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGive us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware.

It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sure that \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905133840/http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\"\u003eSuper Mario 3D World\u003c/a\u003e doesn’t require as much processing power as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905133840/https://www.callofduty.com/advancedwarfare\"\u003eCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u003c/a\u003e, so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant.

Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK).

Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\nSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\nLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\n Super Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2) Mario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.) Metroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.) Super Smash Bros. Brawl Super Paper Mario New Super Mario Bros. …and Donkey Kong Returns was pretty good.  8 good games on that console and everything else was crap. Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\nWii U Wii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  Also, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\nInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\nThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\nWhat’s next with the NX?   Nintendo Account Still, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\nFirst, figure out how to run a freaking Nintendo account.\n  I should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\n  I should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\n  Some of us live international lives. Allow me to log onto my child’s Canadian console using my U.S. account, so that I can continue using my game data (etc.) while spending time with my children in another country.\n  There should not be separate balances for the Wii U store vs. the 3DS store. This is ridiculous. They should be the same store, the same account, the same money. I login, buy stuff, and play.\n  Lastly, I should be able to throw my console in the ocean, buy a new one, log-in, and be able to re-download all of my games and settings.\n  Microsoft has this figured out. Apple has this figured out. Sony has this (sorta) figured out. Why haven’t you been able to figure this out yet?\nNormal Controllers Please, for the love of god, stop making controllers “unique”. I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\n  Give us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware. Save that for games and gameplay, not hardware.\nFigure out the first vs. third-party game situation Nintendo hardware has been running a generation behind ever since the Wii was released in 2006. It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\nI’m sure that Super Mario 3D World doesn’t require as much processing power as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\nYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\nNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant. You make the best games for your own console. But — there are a few things to think about, because you’ve been sending mixed signals for a long time now.\n  If you want to focus on making first-party games on Nintendo consoles, that’s great. But you need to actually focus on making first-party games. You didn’t do this for the first half of the Wii U’s existence.\n  If you don’t want to put much effort into third-party games, that’s cool too — but say so. Stop allowing so much crapware to be sold for Nintendo consoles. But also remember that if the best third-party games are on a Sony or Microsoft console, and customers have a limited budget, who’s console are they going to buy?\n  If you want to enable and support third-party developers, great! Then do it! Provide them support, help them to deliver the best possible gaming experiences, and ship hardware that is as powerful as the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.\n  Embrace Digital Downloads Digital downloads are the now, not just the future. Build out a world-class online store that can be accessed from TV consoles, handheld consoles, and computer Internet users alike. Focus on making downloads both fast and plentiful. Ship fewer and fewer games on disc, and instead ship larger hard drives that support expansion through external disks.\nEmbrace broadband, hard drives, digital downloads, and a world-class online store. You implemented the kids’ version of those things in the Wii U. Now build a modern version for grown-ups.\nPay Attention to your Competition Aside from Nintendo, Apple is the only other company with small-screen (e.g., iOS) and large screen (e.g., macOS, tvOS) gaming platforms. Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK). They have way more users than Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony combined. They have powerful developer frameworks that enable game developers to build bigger, better, faster worlds.\nThe new Apple TV is squarely in your turf. No, they may not have their own Marios or Zeldas or Samuses, but their platform has enabled the likes of Lili, Oceanhorn, and The Legend of Skyfish. They may not (yet) have the rich history of Nintendo’s characters, but it’s only a matter of time.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  Right now, Apple is focused on TV. And that’s probably good for you. But what happens when they ship an Apple TV “Pro” focused on gaming? They have an excellent SDK, an excellent games platform, the MFi Controller program, rock-solid account management, extremely fast game (i.e., “app”) downloads, and a dearth of end-users with limited funds for new game consoles?\nSee the follow-up, “Dear Nintendo, Part II”\n ",

You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\n\n{{\u003c yt \"f5IcBtaMR_k\" \u003e}}\n\nIt also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube.

You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\n\nYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me.

The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence.

This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” […]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb addresses are rich and revealing content.

        "plain":"I’ve been paying quite a bit of attention to the story of Edward Snowden — the former CIA contractor who leaked classified information to the American public about how the government is spying on us through acronym-laden programs known as “PRISM” and “MUSCULAR”.   Allow me to be your tour guide as we uncover just a few of the ways in which the NSA has broken the law and spied on American citizens.\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978) It all started in 1978 with the passage of FISA:\n The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (“FISA” Pub.L. 95–511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. ch. 36) is a United States federal law which prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of “foreign intelligence information” between “foreign powers” and “agents of foreign powers” (which may include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of espionage or terrorism). The law does not apply outside the United States. It has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks.\n FISA was amended in 2001 by The Patriot Act:\n The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. […]\nOn May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the “library records provision”), and conducting surveillance of “lone wolves”—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.\n Then again by the Protect America Act of 2007:\n The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), (Pub.L. 110–55, 121 Stat. 552, enacted by S. 1927), is a controversial amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on August 5, 2007. It removed the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets “reasonably believed” to be outside of the United States. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.\n And yet again by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008:\n Warrantless wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) was revealed publicly in late 2005 by the New York Times and then discontinued in January 2007. […] Approximately forty lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies by groups and individuals alleging that the Bush administration illegally monitored their phone calls or e-mails. Whistleblower evidence suggests that AT\u0026amp;T was complicit in the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, which could have involved the private communications of millions of Americans.\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to * 10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. In addition, the Wiretap Act prohibits any person from illegally intercepting, disclosing, using, or divulging phone calls or electronic communications; this is punishable with a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.\n (All 3 sets of amendments to FISA were passed by Congresses operating during the George W. Bush administration.)\nEdward Snowden , Whistleblower   In May 2013, Edward Snowden ’s leak of Top Secret-level NSA material was called “the most significant leak in U.S. history” by Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers (1971).\nThe U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government secrets. President Obama’s response was reported by Z. Byron Wolf, writing for CNN:\n Even as he announced changes to the NSA programs, including the appointment of an independent government review, at a news conference on Friday, Obama suggested Americans would be better off if they hadn’t found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and Internet data.\n“No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,” Obama said. A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn’t know existed.\nThe leaks, he said, hurt that process.\n Conor Friedersdorf, writing for The Atlantic, talks about why pardoning the whistleblower would be more moral and legal than Team Obama’s treatment of Bush-era interrogators:\n Circa 2008, Barack Obama gave his supporters reason to believe that if he were elected, he would protect whistleblowers and obey U.S. law on the subject of torture.\nHe has disappointed on both subjects.\nLong before Edward Snowden exposed mass surveillance on Americans by the NSA, the Obama Administration was aggressively persecuting former civil servants who blew the whistle on objectionable behavior during the Bush Administration.\n Edward Snowden, in A Manifesto for the Truth:\n Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress this debate. They intimidated journalists and criminalized publishing the truth. At this point, the public was not yet able to evaluate the benefits of the revelations. They relied on their governments to decide correctly. […]\nCitizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public importance. To tell the truth is not a crime.\n The American public’s view has been polarized. Here is what Wikipedia’s entry on Edward Snowden says:\n He has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor, and a patriot. Response from US officials has been similarly varied; Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned Snowden’s actions as having done “huge, grave damage” to US intelligence capabilities, while United States Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the NSA had gone “too far” in some of its surveillance activities and promised that it would be stopped.\n  “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”\n— Mark Twain  Rory Carroll, writing for The Guardian, says that the White House has chosen to reject clemency for Edward Snowden.\n The former NSA employee this week appealed for clemency and an opportunity to address members of Congress about US surveillance. He also asked for international help to lobby the US to drop the charges against him. The White House, stung by domestic and international criticism, has shown growing appetite to rein in some of the NSA programmes that Snowden exposed but it has not softened its hostility to the 30-year-old fugitive. […]\nFeinstein, a Democratic senator from California, remained implacable. “He’s done this enormous disservice to our country. I think the answer is ‘no clemency’,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation.\nThe former NSA contractor could have blown the whistle on excesses by contacting the House and Senate intelligence committees, Feinstein said. “We would certainly have seen him … and looked at that information. That didn’t happen.”\n The NSA’s PRISM program   The information that was leaked by Snowden outlined the PRISM program, run by the NSA. Here is what we’ve learned so far.\nChris Gayomali, writing for the The Week, says that “The United States has allegedly been spying on its own allies”.\n Perhaps the most damning new revelation is that the U.S. government may have been spying on friends as well as foes. Thirty-eight embassies and missions are outlined as “targets” on one document, reports the Guardian.\n Also that “PRISM allegedly collects data from companies in real time”.\n The Post suggests the FBI uses “government equipment on private company property” to retrieve information on a specified target, before it is then passed on to “customers” in either the NSA, CIA, or FBI. If true, this ostensibly allows the government’s data collection to proceed in real time. To refresh your memory: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, PayTalk, AOL, Skype, and YouTube were all reported to be taking part in the PRISM program.\nAnd yet, all the companies have “strenuously denied” involvement, says Mike Masnick at TechDirt, which doesn’t jibe with the Post’s own annotations. Based on the slides, “it’s not at all clear” that Data Intercept Technology Units (DITU) are physically located on private the premises of private companies:\n Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the “DITU” could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders. [TechDirt]\n  The Washington Post, in an article entitled “NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program”, shows slides from a classified presentation about PRISM’s purpose.\n The top-secret PRISM program allows the U.S. intelligence community to gain access from nine Internet companies to a wide range of digital information, including e-mails and stored data, on foreign targets operating outside the United States. The program is court-approved but does not require individual warrants. Instead, it operates under a broader authorization from federal judges who oversee the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Some documents describing the program were first released by The Washington Post on June 6. The newly released documents below give additional details about how the program operates, including the levels of review and supervisory control at the NSA and FBI. The documents also show how the program interacts with the Internet companies. These slides, annotated by The Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and certain portions are redacted.\n This presentation lists Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple as being the sources of data for PRISM.\n  Joshua Brustein, writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, has collected statements from all of the companies named in the leaked NSA documents.\n In a series of terse statement (sic), all the companies named in the reports about NSA’s Internet snooping program, Prism, have denied involvement. All these companies have been compelled to share personal data with the government at some time, which they tacitly acknowledge by saying they only do so after careful consideration and court orders. “Direct access” to servers, though, is a bridge too far, they say […].\n Dara Kerr, writing for CNET, says that “The tech giants [Apple, Google, Microsoft], along with Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL, call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to substantially reform the US government’s mass surveillance practices.”\n Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL penned a letter (pdf) to the lead members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday urging the lawmakers to substantially reform the NSA surveillance practices. The companies also asked for additional oversight and accountability mechanisms for the spying programs.\n“Transparency is a critical first step to an informed public debate, but it is clear that more needs to be done,” the letter reads. “We urge the Administration to work with Congress in addressing these critical reforms that would provide much needed transparency and help rebuild the trust of Internet users around the world.” […]\nThat document leak opened the public’s eyes to the government’s collection of data on US residents through both cellular records and metadata from Internet companies. Since Snowden’s original leak, thousands more documents have surfaced. The NSA and the Obama administration have maintained that the surveillance program was carried out to protect Americans and track down foreign terrorists.\n The piece continues, showing precisely how good intentions mean nothing in the real world.\n The letter sent by the tech companies “applauds” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) who recently sponsored a bill called the USA Freedom Act. This bill has the goal of “ending eavesdropping, dragnet collection, and online monitoring” by the NSA and other government agencies.\nSensenbrenner is considered one of the architects of the Patriot Act, which the NSA often cites as a legal justification for its surveillance activities. However, Sensenbrenner is adamant that mass government spying wasn’t the intention of the Patriot Act.\n“We have to make a balance between security and civil liberties,” Sensenbrenner told the Associated Press in an interview last week. “And the reason the intelligence community has gotten itself into such trouble is they apparently do not see why civil liberties have got to be protected.”\n Isn’t that against the law? You’ve asked a very complex question.\nIf you read up on FISA and its various amendments, it is very clear that for the American government to get information from American companies on American soil, they have to provide probable cause and get a warrant from a judge.\n  What they’ve done is not break the law, but rather go around it. The Guardian has an excellent presentation entitled “NSA Files: Decoded. What the revelations mean for you.” which does a terrific job explaining everything. I would encourage you to take some time learning from it.\n Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.\n What the NSA has done is partner with GCHQ (Britain’s equivalent agency) to tap the private fiber-optic cables that transfer digital data from continent to continent.\nInstead of the American government getting information from American companies on American soil, they’re getting it on British soil — which negates all of the oversight protections that American citizens expect.\nThe British parliament was very aware of the power they had over their own people, and colluded with the NSA to dodge American law. While it’s not technically a violation of FISA (which itself is being contested as unconstitutional), it is absolutely a violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n The ACLU published a piece entitled “Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act” which explains how the Patriot Act violates our Constitutional rights.\nWith regard to “Expanded access to personal records held by third parties”:\n Section 215 of the Patriot Act violates the Constitution in several ways. It:\n  Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.\n  Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.\n  Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.\n  Violates the Fourth Amendment by failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n   With regard to “secret searches”:\n The Patriot Act, however, unconstitutionally amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed. This means that the government can enter a house, apartment or office with a search warrant when the occupants are away, search through their property, take photographs, and in some cases even seize property - and not tell them until later.\nNotice is a crucial check on the government’s power because it forces the authorities to operate in the open, and allows the subject of searches to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. For example, it allows them to point out irregularities in a warrant, such as the fact that the police are at the wrong address, or that the scope of the warrant is being exceeded (for example, by rifling through dresser drawers in a search for a stolen car).\n With regard to “Expansion of the intelligence exception in wiretap law”:\n A 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) created an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for probable cause when the purpose of a wiretap or search was to gather foreign intelligence. The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\n With regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\n Under the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” […]\nWeb addresses are rich and revealing content. The URLs or “addresses” of the Web pages we read are not really addresses, they are the titles of documents that we download from the Internet. When we “visit” a Web page what we are really doing is downloading that page from the Internet onto our computer, where it is displayed. […] That is much richer information than a simple list of the people we have communicated with; it is intimate information that reveals who we are and what we are thinking about - much more like the content of a phone call than the number dialed. After all, it is often said that reading is a “conversation” with the author.\n In order for a federal law to be recognized as unconstitutional, a court case needs to go before the U.S. Supreme Court to be decided. Not many court cases against a federal agency have been able to make it that far, but on occasion, something gets caught.\n In January 2009, the FISA court was notified that the NSA had been querying business records metadata “in a manner that appear[ed] to the Court to be directly contrary” to the court’s order allowing it to so. In response, the FISA court ordered the government to explain itself. These documents detail this exchange as the NSA struggled to understand the business records program and ensure compliance.\n “The court is exceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its order in this matter and, while the court will not direct that specific officials of the executive branch provide sworn declarations in response to this order, the court expects that the declarants will be officials of sufficient stature that they have the authority to speak on behalf of the executive branch.”\n— Reggie Walton   Using this interactive diagram, you can see which laws, amendments and executive orders have enabled the NSA to operate as it currently does.\nSo, what are Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple doing about this? First of all, it needs to be clear that they never knowingly gave this kind of information to the NSA. The NSA colluded with the GCHQ to subvert American law by directly tapping the fiber optic cables that sends data between continents.\n GCHQ offices in England, UK\n Barton Gellman, Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson, writing for The Washington Post, explain “How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data” (emphasis mine).\n Immediately after the story posted online, a reporter asked NSA Director Keith B. Alexander about it at a cybersecurity event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Neither the reporter nor Alexander had read the story yet.\n General, we’re getting some news that’s crossing right now being reported in The Washington Post that there are new Snowden allegations that say the NSA broke into Yahoo and Google’s databases worldwide, that they infiltrated these databases?\n Alexander replied:\n That’s never happened. […] This is not the NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that. And so I don’t know what the report is, but I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\n The story did not say the NSA breaks into “servers” or “databases.” It said the agency, working with its British counterpart, intercepts communications that run on private circuits between the fortress-like data centers that each company operates on multiple continents.\nThe distinction is between “data at rest” and “data on the fly.” The NSA and GCHQ do not break into user accounts that are stored on Yahoo and Google computers. They intercept the information as it travels over fiber optic cables from one data center to another. […]\nThe two companies do not entrust their data center communications to the “public internet,” which is comparable to an international highway system that anyone can use. Instead, they link their data centers with thousands of miles of privately owned or privately leased fiber optic cable – in effect, a system of private highways. When Google and Yahoo have to share a stretch of road with the public internet, they take other precautions to keep their traffic secure. […]\nOur Wednesday story noted that the NSA is governed by fewer rules and less oversight when it does its intelligence collection outside U.S. territory:\n Intercepting communications overseas has clear advantages for the NSA, with looser restrictions and less oversight. NSA documents about the effort refer directly to “full take,” “bulk access” and “high volume” operations on Yahoo and Google networks. Such large-scale collection of Internet content would be illegal in the United States, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA is allowed to presume that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner.\nOutside U.S. territory, statutory restrictions on surveillance seldom apply and the FISC has no jurisdiction. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has acknowledged that Congress conducts little oversight of intelligence-gathering under the presidential authority of Executive Order 12333, which defines the basic powers and responsibilities of the intelligence agencies.\n  (EO 12333 was signed by Ronald Reagan . It was superseded and amended by EO 13355 and EO 13470, both signed by George W. Bush.)\nBrandon Downey , a security engineer at Google, had this to say:\n Fuck these guys.\nI’ve spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google’s users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces. […]\nIt makes me sad because I believe in America.\nNot in that flag-waving bullshit we’ve-got-our-big-trucks-and-bigger-tanks sort of way, but in the way that you can looked a good friend who has a lot of flaws, but every time you meet him, you think, “That guy still has some good ideas going on”.\nBut after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google — one of the greatest things to arise from the internet — seeing this, well, it’s just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\n Mike Hearn , another security engineer at Google, had this to say:\n I now join him in issuing a giant Fuck You to the people who made these slides. I am not American, I am a Brit, but it’s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.\nWe designed this system to keep criminals out. There’s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we’ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.\nUnfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.\nThank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\n Later, in the comments of his post, he explains the following:\n Encryption was being worked on prior to Snowden but it didn’t seem like a high priority because there was no evidence it would achieve anything useful, and it cost a lot of resources. Once it became clear how badly compromised the fiber paths were, there was a crash effort to encrypt everything.\n Sean Gallagher, writing for Ars Technica, says that “Googlers say ‘F*** you’ to NSA, company encrypts internal network”.\n Google has started to encrypt its traffic between its data centers, effectively halting the broad surveillance of its inner workings by the joint National Security Agency-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR. The move turns off a giant source of information to the two agencies, which at one point accounted for nearly a third of the NSA’s daily data intake for its primary intelligence analysis database—at least for now.\nAs of 2012, the NSA developed “defeat fingerprints” to scan the server-to-server communications that powered Google Adwords, Blogger, the BigTable database that powers Google Drive and other applications, and the TeraGoogle search index interface. These fingerprints allowed the NSA to scan Google internal traffic and identify elements associated with the usage of specific individuals or for searches and other behavior around a particular subject of interest (like, say, “pressure cooker bomb”). […]\nA second set of NSA tools, called Serendipity, gave the agency the ability to target specific Google accounts for monitoring as they accessed service, including:\n Chrome synchronization, including bookmark sync to the cloud “Talkgadget,” the Google Talk component of Gmail The now-defunct iGoogle personalized pages Google searches Picasa photo sharing YouTube […]  For Yahoo, the NSA had developed another set of hooks, fully accessing its internal mail protocols as well as its Messenger instant messaging service, advertising tracker, and “Web beacons” used to track whether users had opened HTML-formatted emails. And the agency had to respond to a flood of unwanted data from these sources by instituting blocks—mostly to deal with Yahoo’s periodic movement of entire user mailboxes.\n Chris Baraniuk, writing for Wired, says that Microsoft still doesn’t encrypt server-to-server data.\n A senior Microsoft executive has told a European parliamentary committee that the company does not encrypt its server-to-server data communications.\nDorothee Belz, EMEA VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, made the remark when answering a question from Claude Moraes, MEP, during a meeting at the European Parliament on Monday.\n“Generally, what I can say today is server-to-server transportation is generally not encrypted,” she said. “This is why we are currently reviewing our security system.” […]\nIt’s just one of several leaks by former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden that has concerned the EU’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) in a series of parliamentary hearings.\nPrior to taking questions from MEPs, Belz, who appeared alongside executives from Google and Facebook, reiterated earlier statements from Microsoft by stressing that the company did not openly provide “direct access” to its servers. However, her later admission that the firm has as yet failed to establish server-to-server encryption has raised fears among many within digital liberties groups that a significant breach of privacy could still be perpetrated.\nSam Smith, a technologist at Privacy International, said the unencrypted data could hypothetically relate to any of Microsoft’s cloud services, from Hotmail and Outlook.com email accounts to Xbox Live, Office 365, and SkyDrive cloud storage.\n What now?   The debate Snowden wanted is happening. That in itself is a major achievement.\n Public opinion is polarized over surveillance, but polls show a jump in concern over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations. A Pew poll at the end of July found that for the first time in a decade, the majority of Americans are more concerned about the government infringing on their civil liberties than about a potential terrorist attack. […]\nAccording to a recent study, the majority of Americans believe that preserving the rights of US citizens is more important than preventing terrorist attacks. Since the NSA revelations, Americans have become more opposed to government surveillance that infringes on civil liberties.\n People are turning to the court system more and more.\n In the end, it may be through the courts rather than Congress that genuine reform may come. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched lawsuits that have led to disclosure of hundreds of pages of Fisa (sic) rulings on Section 215. GCHQ and NSA surveillance is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights from Big Brother Watch, English PEN and Open Rights Group.\nSilicon Valley is also taking action through the courts. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, facing a backlash from their users in the US and overseas over mass surveillance, are fighting to be allowed to be more transparent about their dealings with the intelligence agencies. These companies, along with Facebook, Apple and AOL have also written to the Senate intelligence committee demanding reform.\n With as much hate and backbiting I’ve seen among American citizens and Congressional members since 2000, something strange has happened around this issue.\n There are now several major pieces of legislation going through Congress that would introduce at least some reform of the NSA. Among those, the one backed by Feinstein and passed by her committee is the least radical, offering proposals for greater transparency but basically maintaining the status quo. The bulk collection of Americans’ phone call data would be enshrined in US law.\nMore far-reaching is the proposed Intelligence Oversight and Reform Act, with bipartisan support from senators Wyden, Udall, Richard Blumenthal and Rand Paul. It would ban the collection of internet communication data; close loopholes that allow snooping on Americans without a warrant; reform the Fisa court; and provide some protection for companies faced with handing over data to the NSA.\n What about Edward Snowden? After leaving Hawai’i and his job as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong before winding up in Moscow, where Russian President Vladimir Putin granted him temporary asylum and protection from the U.S. government.\nHe most certainly has a rough road ahead of him. There’s no way you can piss-off the U.S. government as badly as he has and plan to remain free forever. Then again, they also said that about Bobby Fischer.\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said:\n “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.”\n I, for one, consider Edward Snowden a hero and a patriot to the highest degree.\nUpdate (2013–12–09) Aol, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! have all gotten together and put forward this new initiative: ReformGovernmentSurviellance.com.\nI’m disappointed that Apple isn’t on this list.\n",

The law does not apply outside the United States. It has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks.\n\nFISA was amended in 2001 by [The Patriot Act]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act\" %}}):\n\n\u003e The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President {{\u003c person name=\"George W. Bush\" \u003e}} on October 26, 2001. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e On May 26, 2011, President {{\u003c person name=\"Barack Obama\" \u003e}} signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the “library records provision”), and conducting surveillance of “lone wolves”—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.\n\nThen again by the [Protect America Act of 2007]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_America_Act_of_2007\" %}}):\n\n\u003e The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), (Pub.L. 110–55, 121 Stat. 552, enacted by S. 1927), is a controversial amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on August 5, 2007. It removed the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets “reasonably believed” to be outside of the United States. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.\n\nAnd yet again by the [FISA Amendments Act of 2008]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FISA_Amendments_Act_of_2008\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Warrantless wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) was revealed publicly in late 2005 by the New York Times and then discontinued in January 2007. \\[…\\] Approximately forty lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies by groups and individuals alleging that the Bush administration illegally monitored their phone calls or e-mails. Whistleblower evidence suggests that AT\u0026T was complicit in the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, which could have involved the private communications of millions of Americans.\n\u003e\n\u003e The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to * 10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. In addition, the Wiretap Act prohibits any person from illegally intercepting, disclosing, using, or divulging phone calls or electronic communications; this is punishable with a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.\n\n(All 3 sets of amendments to FISA were passed by Congresses operating during the George W. Bush administration.)\n\n\n## {{\u003c person name=\"Edward Snowden\" \u003e}}, Whistleblower\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/snowden@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nIn May 2013, {{\u003c person name=\"Edward Snowden\" \u003e}}’s leak of *Top Secret*-level NSA material was called [“the most significant leak in U.S. history”]({{% wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/edward-snowden-daniel-ellsberg-whistleblower-history_n_3413545.html\" %}}) by Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers (1971).\n\nThe U.S. government has [charged Snowden with espionage]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-charges-snowden-with-espionage/2013/06/21/507497d8-dab1-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html\" %}}) and [theft of government secrets]({{% wayback \"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/us-vs-edward-j-snowden-criminal-complaint/496/\" %}}). President Obama’s response was reported by Z. Byron Wolf, [writing for CNN]({{% wayback \"http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower/\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Even as he announced changes to the NSA programs, including the appointment of an independent government review, at a news conference on Friday, Obama suggested Americans would be better off if they hadn’t found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and Internet data.\n\u003e\n\u003e “No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,” Obama said. A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn’t know existed.\n\u003e\n\u003e The leaks, he said, hurt that process.\n\nConor Friedersdorf, [writing for The Atlantic]({{% wayback \"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/clemency-for-torturers-but-not-for-edward-snowden/281142/\" %}}), talks about why pardoning the whistleblower would be more moral and legal than Team Obama’s treatment of Bush-era interrogators:\n\n\u003e Circa 2008, Barack Obama gave his supporters reason to believe that if he were elected, he would protect whistleblowers and obey U.S. law on the subject of torture.\n\u003e\n\u003e He has disappointed on both subjects.\n\u003e\n\u003e Long before Edward Snowden exposed mass surveillance on Americans by the NSA, the Obama Administration was aggressively persecuting former civil servants who blew the whistle on objectionable behavior during the Bush Administration.\n\nEdward Snowden, in [A Manifesto for the Truth]({{% wayback \"http://www.globalresearch.ca/a-manifesto-for-the-truth/5356919\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress this debate. They intimidated journalists and criminalized publishing the truth. At this point, the public was not yet able to evaluate the benefits of the revelations. They relied on their governments to decide correctly. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Citizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public importance. To tell the truth is not a crime.\n\nThe American public’s view has been polarized. Here is what [Wikipedia’s entry on Edward Snowden]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden\" %}}) says:\n\n\u003e He has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor, and a patriot. Response from US officials has been similarly varied; Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned Snowden’s actions as having done “huge, grave damage” to US intelligence capabilities, while United States Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the NSA had gone “too far” in some of its surveillance activities and promised that it would be stopped.\n\n\u003e “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — {{\u003c person name=\"Mark Twain\" \u003e}}\n\nRory Carroll, [writing for The Guardian]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/white-house-nsa-edward-snowden-clemency\" %}}), says that the White House has chosen to reject clemency for Edward Snowden.\n\n\u003e The former NSA employee this week appealed for clemency and an opportunity to address members of Congress about US surveillance. He also asked for international help to lobby the US to drop the charges against him. The White House, stung by domestic and international criticism, has shown growing appetite to rein in some of the NSA programmes that Snowden exposed but it has not softened its hostility to the 30-year-old fugitive. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Feinstein, a Democratic senator from California, remained implacable. “He’s done this enormous disservice to our country. I think the answer is ‘no clemency’,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation.\n\u003e\n\u003e The former NSA contractor could have blown the whistle on excesses by contacting the House and Senate intelligence committees, Feinstein said. “We would certainly have seen him … and looked at that information. That didn’t happen.”\n\n\n## The NSA’s PRISM program\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/prism@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nThe information that was leaked by Snowden outlined the PRISM program, run by the NSA. Here is what we’ve learned so far.\n\nChris Gayomali, [writing for the The Week]({{% wayback \"http://theweek.com/article/index/246349/3-big-revelations-from-the-newly-leaked-nsa-documents\" %}}), says that “The United States has allegedly been spying on its own allies”.\n\n\u003e Perhaps the most damning new revelation is that the U.S. government may have been spying on friends as well as foes. Thirty-eight embassies and missions are outlined as “targets” on one document, reports the Guardian.\n\nAlso that “PRISM allegedly collects data from companies in real time”.\n\n\u003e The Post suggests the FBI uses “government equipment on private company property” to retrieve information on a specified target, before it is then passed on to “customers” in either the NSA, CIA, or FBI. If true, this ostensibly allows the government’s data collection to proceed in real time. To refresh your memory: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, PayTalk, AOL, Skype, and YouTube were all reported to be taking part in the PRISM program.\n\u003e\n\u003e And yet, all the companies have “strenuously denied” involvement, says Mike Masnick at TechDirt, which doesn’t jibe with the Post’s own annotations. Based on the slides, “it’s not at all clear” that Data Intercept Technology Units (DITU) are physically located on private the premises of private companies:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the “DITU” could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders. \\[[TechDirt]({{% wayback \"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130701/00444723675/newly-leaked-nsa-slides-prism-add-to-confusion-rather-than-clear-it-up.shtml\" %}})\\]\n\n*The Washington Post*, in an article entitled [“NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program”]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/\" %}}), shows slides from a classified presentation about PRISM’s purpose.\n\n\u003e The top-secret PRISM program allows the U.S. intelligence community to gain access from nine Internet companies to a wide range of digital information, including e-mails and stored data, on foreign targets operating outside the United States. The program is court-approved but does not require individual warrants. Instead, it operates under a broader authorization from federal judges who oversee the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Some documents describing the program were first released by The Washington Post on June 6. The newly released documents below give additional details about how the program operates, including the levels of review and supervisory control at the NSA and FBI. The documents also show how the program interacts with the Internet companies. These slides, annotated by The Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and certain portions are redacted.\n\nThis presentation lists Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple as being the sources of data for PRISM.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/prism-affected.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nJoshua Brustein, [writing for Bloomberg Businessweek]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-07/the-companies-lines-on-prism\" %}}), has collected statements from all of the companies named in the leaked NSA documents.\n\n\u003e In a series of terse statement *(sic)*, all the companies named in the reports about NSA’s Internet snooping program, Prism, have denied involvement. All these companies have been compelled to share personal data with the government at some time, which they tacitly acknowledge by saying they only do so after careful consideration and court orders. “Direct access” to servers, though, is a bridge too far, they say \\[…\\].\n\nDara Kerr, [writing for CNET]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57610342-83/apple-google-microsoft-unite-against-nsa-spying-program/\" %}}), says that “The tech giants \\[Apple, Google, Microsoft\\], along with Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL, call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to substantially reform the US government’s mass surveillance practices.”\n\n\u003e Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL penned a letter ([pdf]({{% wayback \"http://www.scribd.com/doc/180596438/USA-Freedom-Act-Letter-10-31-13-pdf\" %}})) to the lead members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday urging the lawmakers to substantially reform the NSA surveillance practices. The companies also asked for additional oversight and accountability mechanisms for the spying programs.\n\u003e\n\u003e “Transparency is a critical first step to an informed public debate, but it is clear that more needs to be done,” the letter reads. “We urge the Administration to work with Congress in addressing these critical reforms that would provide much needed transparency and help rebuild the trust of Internet users around the world.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e That document leak opened the public’s eyes to the government’s collection of data on US residents through both cellular records and metadata from Internet companies. Since Snowden’s original leak, thousands more documents have surfaced. The NSA and the Obama administration have maintained that the surveillance program was carried out to protect Americans and track down foreign terrorists.\n\nThe piece continues, showing precisely how good intentions mean nothing in the real world.\n\n\u003e The letter sent by the tech companies “applauds” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) who recently sponsored a bill called the USA Freedom Act. This bill has the goal of “ending eavesdropping, dragnet collection, and online monitoring” by the NSA and other government agencies.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sensenbrenner is considered one of the architects of the Patriot Act, which the NSA often cites as a legal justification for its surveillance activities. However, Sensenbrenner is adamant that mass government spying wasn’t the intention of the Patriot Act.\n\u003e\n\u003e “We have to make a balance between security and civil liberties,” Sensenbrenner told the Associated Press in an interview last week. “And the reason the intelligence community has gotten itself into such trouble is they apparently do not see why civil liberties have got to be protected.”\n\n\n## Isn’t that against the law?\n\nYou’ve asked a very complex question.\n\nIf you read up on FISA and its various amendments, it is very clear that for the American government to get information from American companies on American soil, they have to provide probable cause and get a warrant from a judge.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/fisa@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nWhat they’ve done is not break the law, but rather *go around it*. *The Guardian* has an excellent presentation entitled [“NSA Files: Decoded. What the revelations mean for you.”]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\" %}}) which does a terrific job explaining everything. I would encourage you to take some time learning from it.\n\n\u003e Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.\n\nWhat the NSA has done is partner with [GCHQ]({{% wayback \"http://www.gchq.gov.uk\" %}}) (Britain’s equivalent agency) to tap the private fiber-optic cables that transfer digital data from continent to continent.\n\nInstead of the American government getting information from American companies on American soil, they’re getting it on *British soil* — which negates all of the oversight protections that American citizens expect.\n\nThe British parliament was [very aware of the power they had over their own people]({{% wayback \"http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/mps-admit-they-knew-how-powerful-gchq-had-become-1-3181385\" %}}), and colluded with the NSA to dodge American law. While it’s not *technically* a violation of FISA (which itself is being contested as unconstitutional), it is *absolutely* a violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u003e “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n\nThe ACLU published a piece entitled [“Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act”]({{% wayback \"https://www.aclu.org/national-security/surveillance-under-usa-patriot-act\" %}}) which explains how the Patriot Act violates our Constitutional rights.\n\nWith regard to “Expanded access to personal records held by third parties”:\n\n\u003e Section 215 of the Patriot Act violates the Constitution in several ways. It:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the Fourth Amendment by failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nWith regard to “secret searches”:\n\n\u003e The Patriot Act, however, unconstitutionally amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed. This means that the government can enter a house, apartment or office with a search warrant when the occupants are away, search through their property, take photographs, and in some cases even seize property - and not tell them until later.\n\u003e\n\u003e Notice is a crucial check on the government’s power because it forces the authorities to operate in the open, and allows the subject of searches to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. For example, it allows them to point out irregularities in a warrant, such as the fact that the police are at the wrong address, or that the scope of the warrant is being exceeded (for example, by rifling through dresser drawers in a search for a stolen car).\n\nWith regard to “Expansion of the intelligence exception in wiretap law”:\n\n\u003e A 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) created an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for probable cause when the purpose of a wiretap or search was to gather foreign intelligence. The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\n\nWith regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\n\n\u003e Under the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Web addresses are rich and revealing content. The URLs or “addresses” of the Web pages we read are not really addresses, they are the titles of documents that we download from the Internet. When we “visit” a Web page what we are really doing is downloading that page from the Internet onto our computer, where it is displayed. \\[…\\] That is much richer information than a simple list of the people we have communicated with; it is intimate information that reveals who we are and what we are thinking about - much more like the content of a phone call than the number dialed. After all, it is often said that reading is a “conversation” with the author.\n\nIn order for a federal law to be recognized as unconstitutional, a court case needs to go before the U.S. Supreme Court to be decided. Not many court cases against a federal agency have been able to make it that far, but on occasion, [something gets caught]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#interactive/7\" %}}).\n\n\u003e In January 2009, the FISA court was notified that the NSA had been querying business records metadata “in a manner that appear\\[ed\\] to the Court to be directly contrary” to the court’s order allowing it to so. In response, the FISA court ordered the government to explain itself. These documents detail this exchange as the NSA struggled to understand the business records program and ensure compliance.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e “The court is exceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its order in this matter and, while the court will not direct that specific officials of the executive branch provide sworn declarations in response to this order, the court expects that the declarants will be officials of sufficient stature that they have the authority to speak on behalf of the executive branch.”\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e — {{\u003c person name=\"Reggie Walton\" \u003e}}\n\nUsing [this interactive diagram]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#interactive/14\" %}}), you can see which laws, amendments and executive orders have enabled the NSA to operate as it currently does.\n\n\n## So, what are Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple doing about this?\n\nFirst of all, it needs to be clear that **they never knowingly gave this kind of information to the NSA**. The NSA colluded with the GCHQ to subvert American law by directly tapping the fiber optic cables that sends data between continents.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/gchq-building@2x.jpg\" figure=\"GCHQ offices in England, UK\"\u003e}}\n\nBarton Gellman, Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson, [writing for The Washington Post]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/\" %}}), explain “How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data” (emphasis **mine**).\n\n\u003e Immediately after the story posted online, a reporter asked NSA Director Keith B. Alexander about it at a cybersecurity event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Neither the reporter nor Alexander had read the story yet.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e General, we’re getting some news that’s crossing right now being reported in The Washington Post that there are new Snowden allegations that say the NSA broke into Yahoo and Google’s databases worldwide, that they infiltrated these databases?\n\u003e\n\u003e Alexander replied:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e That’s never happened. \\[…\\] This is not the NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that. And so I don’t know what the report is, but I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\n\u003e\n\u003e The story did not say the NSA breaks into “servers” or “databases.” It said the agency, working with its British counterpart, **intercepts communications that run on private circuits between the fortress-like data centers that each company operates on multiple continents**.\n\u003e\n\u003e The distinction is between “data at rest” and “data on the fly.” The NSA and GCHQ do not break into user accounts that are stored on Yahoo and Google computers. **They intercept the information as it travels over fiber optic cables from one data center to another**. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e The two companies do not entrust their data center communications to the “public internet,” which is comparable to an international highway system that anyone can use. **Instead, they link their data centers with thousands of miles of privately owned or privately leased fiber optic cable – in effect, a system of private highways.** When Google and Yahoo have to share a stretch of road with the public internet, they take other precautions to keep their traffic secure. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Our Wednesday story noted that the NSA is governed by fewer rules and less oversight when it does its intelligence collection outside U.S. territory:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e Intercepting communications overseas has clear advantages for the NSA, with looser restrictions and less oversight. **NSA documents about the effort refer directly to “full take,” “bulk access” and “high volume” operations on Yahoo and Google networks.** Such large-scale collection of Internet content would be illegal in the United States, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA is allowed to presume that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner.\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e Outside U.S. territory, statutory restrictions on surveillance seldom apply and the FISC has no jurisdiction. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has acknowledged that **Congress conducts little oversight of intelligence-gathering under the presidential authority of Executive Order 12333, which defines the basic powers and responsibilities of the intelligence agencies**.\n\n([EO 12333]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333\" %}}) was signed by {{\u003c person name=\"Ronald Reagan\" \u003e}}. It was superseded and amended by [EO 13355]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13355\" %}}) and [EO 13470]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13470\" %}}), both signed by George W. Bush.)\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Brandon Downey\" \u003e}}, a security engineer at Google, [had this to say]({{% wayback \"https://plus.google.com/108799184931623330498/posts/SfYy8xbDWGG\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Fuck these guys.\n\u003e\n\u003e I’ve spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google’s users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e It makes me sad because I believe in America.\n\u003e\n\u003e Not in that flag-waving bullshit we’ve-got-our-big-trucks-and-bigger-tanks sort of way, but in the way that you can looked a good friend who has a lot of flaws, but every time you meet him, you think, “That guy still has some good ideas going on”.\n\u003e\n\u003e But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google — one of the greatest things to arise from the internet — seeing this, well, it’s just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Mike Hearn\" \u003e}}, another security engineer at Google, [had this to say]({{% wayback \"https://plus.google.com/+MikeHearn/posts/LW1DXJ2BK8k\" %}}):\n\n\u003e I now join him in issuing a giant Fuck You to the people who made these slides. I am not American, I am a Brit, but it’s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.\n\u003e\n\u003e We designed this system to keep criminals out. There’s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we’ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.\n\u003e\n\u003e Unfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\n\nLater, in the comments of his post, he explains the following:\n\n\u003e Encryption was being worked on prior to Snowden but it didn’t seem like a high priority because there was no evidence it would achieve anything useful, and it cost a lot of resources. Once it became clear how badly compromised the fiber paths were, there was a crash effort to encrypt everything.\n\nSean Gallagher, [writing for Ars Technica]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/googlers-say-f-you-to-nsa-company-encrypts-internal-network/\" %}}), says that “Googlers say ‘F\\*\\*\\* you’ to NSA, company encrypts internal network”.\n\n\u003e Google has started to encrypt its traffic between its data centers, effectively halting the broad surveillance of its inner workings by the joint National Security Agency-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR. The move turns off a giant source of information to the two agencies, which at one point accounted for nearly a third of the NSA’s daily data intake for its primary intelligence analysis database—at least for now.\n\u003e\n\u003e As of 2012, the NSA developed “defeat fingerprints” to scan the server-to-server communications that powered Google Adwords, Blogger, the BigTable database that powers Google Drive and other applications, and the TeraGoogle search index interface. These fingerprints allowed the NSA to scan Google internal traffic and identify elements associated with the usage of specific individuals or for searches and other behavior around a particular subject of interest (like, say, “pressure cooker bomb”). \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e A second set of NSA tools, called Serendipity, gave the agency the ability to target specific Google accounts for monitoring as they accessed service, including:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Chrome synchronization, including bookmark sync to the cloud\n\u003e * “Talkgadget,” the Google Talk component of Gmail\n\u003e * The now-defunct iGoogle personalized pages\n\u003e * Google searches\n\u003e * Picasa photo sharing\n\u003e * YouTube \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e For Yahoo, the NSA had developed another set of hooks, fully accessing its internal mail protocols as well as its Messenger instant messaging service, advertising tracker, and “Web beacons” used to track whether users had opened HTML-formatted emails. And the agency had to respond to a flood of unwanted data from these sources by instituting blocks—mostly to deal with Yahoo’s periodic movement of entire user mailboxes.\n\nChris Baraniuk, [writing for Wired]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/we-still-dont-encrypt-server-to-server-data-admits-microsoft/\" %}}), says that Microsoft still doesn’t encrypt server-to-server data.\n\n\u003e A senior Microsoft executive has told a European parliamentary committee that the company does not encrypt its server-to-server data communications.\n\u003e\n\u003e Dorothee Belz, EMEA VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, made the remark when answering a question from Claude Moraes, MEP, during a meeting at the European Parliament on Monday.\n\u003e\n\u003e “Generally, what I can say today is server-to-server transportation is generally not encrypted,” she said. “This is why we are currently reviewing our security system.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s just one of several leaks by former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden that has concerned the EU’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) in a series of parliamentary hearings.\n\u003e\n\u003e Prior to taking questions from MEPs, Belz, who appeared alongside executives from Google and Facebook, reiterated earlier statements from Microsoft by stressing that the company did not openly provide “direct access” to its servers. However, her later admission that the firm has as yet failed to establish server-to-server encryption has raised fears among many within digital liberties groups that a significant breach of privacy could still be perpetrated.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sam Smith, a technologist at Privacy International, said the unencrypted data could hypothetically relate to any of Microsoft’s cloud services, from Hotmail and Outlook.com email accounts to Xbox Live, Office 365, and SkyDrive cloud storage.\n\n\n## What now?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/hands-off-my-metadata@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n[The debate Snowden wanted is happening]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/6\" %}}). That in itself is a major achievement.\n\n\u003e Public opinion is polarized over surveillance, but polls show a jump in concern over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations. A [Pew poll at the end of July]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/poll-nsa-surveillance-privacy-pew\" %}}) found that for the first time in a decade, the majority of Americans are more concerned about the government infringing on their civil liberties than about a potential terrorist attack. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e According to a recent study, the majority of Americans believe that preserving the rights of US citizens is more important than preventing terrorist attacks. Since the NSA revelations, Americans have become more opposed to government surveillance that infringes on civil liberties.\n\nPeople are turning to the court system more and more.\n\n\u003e In the end, it may be through the courts rather than Congress that genuine reform may come. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched lawsuits that have led to disclosure of hundreds of pages of Fisa *(sic)* rulings on Section 215. GCHQ and NSA surveillance is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights from Big Brother Watch, English PEN and Open Rights Group.\n\u003e\n\u003e Silicon Valley is also taking action through the courts. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, facing a backlash from their users in the US and overseas over mass surveillance, are fighting to be allowed to be more transparent about their dealings with the intelligence agencies. These companies, along with Facebook, Apple and AOL have also written to the Senate intelligence committee demanding reform.\n\nWith as much hate and backbiting I’ve seen among American citizens and Congressional members since 2000, something strange has happened around this issue.\n\n\u003e There are now several major pieces of legislation going through Congress that would introduce at least some reform of the NSA. Among those, the one backed by Feinstein and passed by her committee is the least radical, offering proposals for greater transparency but basically maintaining the status quo. The bulk collection of Americans’ phone call data would be enshrined in US law.\n\u003e\n\u003e More far-reaching is the proposed Intelligence Oversight and Reform Act, with bipartisan support from senators Wyden, Udall, Richard Blumenthal and Rand Paul. It would ban the collection of internet communication data; close loopholes that allow snooping on Americans without a warrant; reform the Fisa court; and provide some protection for companies faced with handing over data to the NSA.\n\n\n## What about Edward Snowden?\n\nAfter leaving Hawai’i and his job as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong before winding up in Moscow, where Russian President {{\u003c person name=\"Vladimir Putin\" \u003e}} granted him temporary asylum and protection from the U.S. government.\n\nHe most certainly has a rough road ahead of him. There’s no way you can piss-off the U.S. government as badly as he has and plan to remain free forever. Then again, they also said that about Bobby Fischer.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\" \u003e}} once said:\n\n\u003e “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.”\n\nI, for one, consider Edward Snowden a hero and a patriot to the highest degree.\n\n\n## Update (2013–12–09)\n\nAol, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! have all gotten together and put forward this new initiative: [ReformGovernmentSurviellance.com]({{% wayback \"http://reformgovernmentsurviellance.com\" %}}).\n\nI’m disappointed that Apple isn’t on this list.\n"},

They were usually a blend of 8 alphanumeric and/or symbol characters. Nothing too wild, but after a while, I established some muscle memory around typing them and began to rely on them. This is a better approach than most people use, but it’s still a terrible practice. Over time, I began appending special characters here, or prepending them there. Sometimes I would stick a dollar sign or two somewhere in the middle to mix things up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"enter-1password\"\u003eEnter 1Password\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/1password@2x.png\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen in 2008, I discovered a piece of software called \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090348/https://agilebits.com/onepassword\"\u003e1Password\u003c/a\u003e. Initially I balked at the price. \u0026ldquo;You want me to \u003cem\u003epay\u003c/em\u003e for software?!\u0026rdquo; Clearly I was still in a Windows-user’s state of mind when it came to things like that. But I sucked it up, bought a license, and started using it regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the single best investment I’ve ever made. Software-wise, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"openid-and-oauth\"\u003eOpenID and OAuth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/oauth@2x.png\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround the same time as when I discovered 1Password, I also learned about something called \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090348/http://openid.net\"\u003eOpenID\u003c/a\u003e. The approach that OpenID takes is known as \u003cem\u003eFederated Identity\u003c/em\u003e. It’s essentially a system where two people don’t know or trust each other, but they both trust a third person, and that third person vouches for each of the first two. Eric and Jeff don’t know each other, but they both know me. I vouch for Jeff with Eric saying that he’s a cool dude, and vice-versa. Make sense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt allowed me to trust a company of my choosing to vouch for me, whenever I came to log into sites which supported OpenID. If something happened and I didn’t trust that middle company any more, I could simply change the company/service which vouched for me. In that way, I only had to remember the username and password for that one company that was vouching for me, instead of having to create all-new accounts for every service I signed-up for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were some quirks that made OpenID a bit harder to understand for normal folks, so the great minds of the Internet got together and bore a different system known as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090348/http://oauth.net\"\u003eOAuth\u003c/a\u003e. You know all of those sites you visit that have a big blue button that says “Login with Facebook”? That’s OAuth in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOAuth works a bit differently behind the scenes. You say, “I want to sign up for your site”. The website says, \u0026ldquo;Either give me your information so I can register you, or you can \u003cem\u003eauthorize\u003c/em\u003e me to get your information from someone else who already has it.\u0026rdquo; And you respond with, “Sure. Facebook has it.” You then click the blue button, tell Facebook that you authorize the new site to pull your information, and away you go. Between the two approaches, OAuth is used about a zillion times more often than OpenID is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would recommend using OpenID or OAuth for handling your login information if at all possible because it reduces the number of passwords you need to keep track of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"sonys-playstation-network-got-hacked\"\u003eSony’s Playstation Network got hacked\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember when this happened?

As such, I had the fine work ahead of me to change the password for every single site that used the password that got hacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1Password to the rescue! It took me about 90 minutes, but I was able to lookup all of the sites where this password was being used, and change the password for all of them.

This is where besides having the username and password (i.e., the first “factor”), you also need a code from a key fob or something else that you have with you at all times (i.e., the second “factor”).

        "plain":"I learned at a relatively young age what makes a good password versus a bad password, and I’ve tried to always use these qualities in the passwords that I choose.   The Problem Unfortunately, even with the best intentions, you inevitably end up re-using one or a few passwords across every single website you log into. Some people do things as dumb as using the name of their significant other. Or their pet. Or a birthdate. Or something else equally guessable by one of the many supercomputers that exist (whereby “supercomputer”, I mean pretty much any computer invented in the past 5–7 years).\nMy approach was this: Whenever a website would auto-generate a random password for me, instead of changing it to something I could remember, I simply memorized it. They were usually a blend of 8 alphanumeric and/or symbol characters. Nothing too wild, but after a while, I established some muscle memory around typing them and began to rely on them. This is a better approach than most people use, but it’s still a terrible practice. Over time, I began appending special characters here, or prepending them there. Sometimes I would stick a dollar sign or two somewhere in the middle to mix things up.\nEnter 1Password   Then in 2008, I discovered a piece of software called 1Password. Initially I balked at the price. \u0026ldquo;You want me to pay for software?!\u0026rdquo; Clearly I was still in a Windows-user’s state of mind when it came to things like that. But I sucked it up, bought a license, and started using it regularly.\nIt is the single best investment I’ve ever made. Software-wise, anyway.\nOpenID and OAuth   Around the same time as when I discovered 1Password, I also learned about something called OpenID. The approach that OpenID takes is known as Federated Identity. It’s essentially a system where two people don’t know or trust each other, but they both trust a third person, and that third person vouches for each of the first two. Eric and Jeff don’t know each other, but they both know me. I vouch for Jeff with Eric saying that he’s a cool dude, and vice-versa. Make sense?\nIt allowed me to trust a company of my choosing to vouch for me, whenever I came to log into sites which supported OpenID. If something happened and I didn’t trust that middle company any more, I could simply change the company/service which vouched for me. In that way, I only had to remember the username and password for that one company that was vouching for me, instead of having to create all-new accounts for every service I signed-up for.\nBut there were some quirks that made OpenID a bit harder to understand for normal folks, so the great minds of the Internet got together and bore a different system known as OAuth. You know all of those sites you visit that have a big blue button that says “Login with Facebook”? That’s OAuth in action.\nOAuth works a bit differently behind the scenes. You say, “I want to sign up for your site”. The website says, \u0026ldquo;Either give me your information so I can register you, or you can authorize me to get your information from someone else who already has it.\u0026rdquo; And you respond with, “Sure. Facebook has it.” You then click the blue button, tell Facebook that you authorize the new site to pull your information, and away you go. Between the two approaches, OAuth is used about a zillion times more often than OpenID is.\nI would recommend using OpenID or OAuth for handling your login information if at all possible because it reduces the number of passwords you need to keep track of.\nSony’s Playstation Network got hacked Remember when this happened? Where Sony was storing passwords in m********king plain text?! (To paraphrase Shepherd Book from Firefly/Serenity, there is a special place in Hell for people who rape, murder, talk during movies, and store passwords in plain text.)\n  In short, one of my hard-to-guess-but-used-in-lots-of-places passwords was one of the ones that was obtained by hackers. As such, I had the fine work ahead of me to change the password for every single site that used the password that got hacked.\n1Password to the rescue! It took me about 90 minutes, but I was able to lookup all of the sites where this password was being used, and change the password for all of them. This event ended up making me re-think how I managed my passwords.\nAuthy and 2-Factor Authentication   Over the past couple of years, I’ve started to see more and more websites begin leveraging something called 2-Factor Authentication (or, Multi-Factor Authentication). This is where besides having the username and password (i.e., the first “factor”), you also need a code from a key fob or something else that you have with you at all times (i.e., the second “factor”). This way, even if somebody figured out your username and password, they still wouldn’t be able to get into your account unless they also had either a key fob with a code, or more commonly, your cell phone.\nBesides having a key fob for logging into my company’s VPN remotely, I’d never heard of 2-Factor Authentication until Amazon Web Services announced it as a new feature of their Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.

Besides looking and working WAY better than Google Authenticator, it supported lots of different accounts. The switch was a no-brainer.\nSites that I’m currently aware of that support 2-Factor Authentication are:\n ADN (aka, App.net) Apple (account management, only) Amazon Web Services (AWS) Dreamhost Dropbox Evernote (Premium accounts) Facebook GoDaddy Google Microsoft (including Hotmail \u0026amp; Xbox) Paypal Stripe.com WordPress.com (including Gravatar) and more!  You can even install the Authy plugin in your self-hosted WordPress installation to enable extra security for your blog. I would absolutely recommend enabling 2-Factor Authentication (using Authy, of course) for every single service you use that supports it.\nChanging every password   2 days ago, I decided to bite the bullet and put in the work to change every single password I had stored in 1Password (around 250). Using their built-in password generator, I created a brand-new, completely randomized password, using a mix of upper/lower-case letters, numbers and symbols. These new passwords are all 24–30 characters long, except for services that required shorter ones, or only allowed alphanumeric characters.\nI have absolutely no idea what any of my passwords are.
