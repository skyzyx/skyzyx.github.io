        "source":"\nApple’s [fall product announcement]({{% wayback \"http://live.theverge.com/apple-iphone-5s-liveblog/\" %}}) begins at 10am PST; 1pm EST.\n\n## My guesses?\n\n* **Definitely:** Next-gen iPhone 5S, iOS 7, OS X Mavericks, iTunes 11 (with iTunes Radio), updated MacBook Pro.\n\n* **Maybe:** New iPads (though I’d bet on spring instead), lower unsubsidized-cost iPhone for other (non-American) countries, updated iMac, updated Thunderbolt 2 display (with USB 3.0).\n\n* **Not a chance:** An HDTV, a wrist-watch, a pull-string-to-talk Steve Jobs doll.\n\n## How’d I do?\n\nHow good were my predictions? Well, this event was a little shorter than I was expecting and they only covered iPhone-related stuff.\n\n* Next-gen [iPhone 5S]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/\" %}}). Check.\n\n* [iOS 7]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ios/\" %}}). Check.\n\n* [iTunes Radio]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/\" %}}). Sort-of. It got coverage on the website, but not the event.\n\n* [Lower unsubsidized-cost iPhone]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/\" %}}) for other (non-American) countries. I’m going to say I was wrong. Instead, Apple changed their strategy and created a slightly-modified iPhone 5 called the *5c*.\n\n* New MacBook Pro. I was also wrong here.\n"},
