I couldn’t see the sense in paying a ton of money every month for 500 channels that I didn’t watch, just so that I could catch the occasional show. I invested in Netflix and Hulu Plus accounts so that I could watch most of my shows, and for the shows that haven’t made their way into the 21 century yet, there are plenty of places online where you can acquire the latest episodes.\nIf you read my previous post on converting Blu-ray and DVD movies to MP4, this process has a slightly different flow.\nCrash Course in Digital Video Formats These days, if you (ahem) acquire a high-definition copy of your favorite show online (commonly in 720p), it will most likely be in MKV/H.264/AC3 format.\n  The short explanation is that every video file is made up of 3 different parts: the video stream, the audio stream, and the container. The audio and video are synced-up (a.k.a., “multiplexed” or “muxed”) and are bundled together into a single file using a container format.\nIf you want to make yourself a little more educated about this stuff, check out the “Video on the Web” chapter of Dive Into HTML5 by Mark Pilgrim.\nMKV is a popular container format because it’s designed to be a kitchen sink. You can throw all sorts of stuff inside this container, so people like to stash it full of subtitle files and other sorts of things. AC3 is the name of the Dolby Digital surround-sound audio format. You typically need a dedicated decoder ship to handle this kind of audio, which is common in modern receivers and some TVs.\nMKV → MP4 The first thing we need to do download a copy of MP4Tools.\nWhile you can use it without a license, it’s always a good idea to support the independent software developers who write this stuff — especially if its useful.\n  When you drag your MKV file into MP4Tools, you should see two entries — the video stream and the audio stream.\nThe video stream should already be in H.264 format.

        "source":"\n{{\u003c description \u003e}}\nNearly 2 years ago, I became a \u003cem\u003eCord-Cutter\u003c/em\u003e. I couldn’t see the sense in paying a ton of money every month for 500 channels that I didn’t watch, just so that I could catch the occasional show.\n{{\u003c /description \u003e}}\n\nI invested in [Netflix]({{% wayback \"http://netflix.com\" %}}) and [Hulu Plus]({{% wayback \"http://hulu.com/plus\" %}}) accounts so that I could watch most of my shows, and for the shows that haven’t made their way into the 21 century yet, there are plenty of places online where you can acquire the latest episodes.\n\nIf you read my previous post on [converting Blu-ray and DVD movies to MP4](/2013/04/08/converting-blu-ray-and-dvd-movies-to-mp4-using-mac-os-x-for-playback-on-ipad-apple-tv-playstation-3-xbox-360-roku-and-other-players/), this process has a slightly different flow.\n\n\n## Crash Course in Digital Video Formats\n\nThese days, if you (ahem) *acquire* a high-definition copy of your favorite show online (commonly in 720p), it will most likely be in MKV/H.264/AC3 format.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/mkv.png\"\u003e}}\n\nThe short explanation is that every video file is made up of **3 different parts**: the **video stream**, the **audio stream**, and the **container**. The audio and video are synced-up (a.k.a., “multiplexed” or “muxed”) and are bundled together into a single file using a container format.\n\nIf you want to make yourself a little more educated about this stuff, check out the “[Video on the Web]({{% wayback \"http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html\" %}})” chapter of *Dive Into HTML5* by Mark Pilgrim.\n\n**MKV** is a popular container format because it’s designed to be a kitchen sink. You can throw all sorts of stuff inside this container, so people like to stash it full of subtitle files and other sorts of things. **AC3** is the name of the *Dolby Digital* surround-sound audio format. You typically need a dedicated decoder ship to handle this kind of audio, which is common in modern receivers and some TVs.\n\n\n## MKV → MP4\n\nThe first thing we need to do download a copy of [MP4Tools]({{% wayback \"http://www.emmgunn.com/mp4tools/mp4toolshome.html\" %}}).\n\nWhile you can use it without a license, it’s always a good idea to support the independent software developers who write this stuff — especially if its useful.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/mp4tools-default.png\"\u003e}}\n\nWhen you drag your MKV file into MP4Tools, you should see two entries — the video stream and the audio stream.\n\nThe video stream should already be in **H.264** format. (If it isn’t, stop what you’re doing and run the file through [Handbrake]({{% wayback \"http://handbrake.fr\" %}}) instead.) Check the box next to the stream to select it.\n\nIf the audio stream is already in **AAC** format, this will be very simple. If the audio stream is in **AC3** format, this will still be simple, but will take a little longer to complete.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/mp4tools-working.png\"\u003e}}\n\n1. For **H.264** video, choose *Pass Thru*.\n\n2. For **AAC** audio (if available), choose *Pass Thru*.\n\n3. For **AC3** audio (if available), choose the highest AAC audio selection you have available (either *AAC (2-Ch.)* or *AAC (5.1)*). If you selected *AAC (5.1)*, also check the box for *add 2-Ch. Track*.\n\nLastly, choose your intended device. The *Apple TV* setting tends to have the broadest compatibility in my experience. Leave everything else as the default setting, and click the *Convert* button.\n\nIn a few minutes, you should have a new `.m4v` file.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/m4v.png\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Metadata and Artwork\n\nIt’s possible that you may have heard of *AtomicParsley*, *MetaX* or *MetaZ* before. They all suck. Check out [Subler]({{% wayback \"http://code.google.com/p/subler/\" %}}) instead.\n\nOnce you have your `.m4v` file, you’ll want to add the metadata and artwork to the file. As long as the video file starts with a format similar to `\u003cshow\u003e.s\u003c#\u003ee\u003c#\u003e` (e.g., `Weeds.s7e1`), Subler will be able to determine the right things to search for.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/subler-metadata.png\"\u003e}}\n\nSubler queries [TVDB]({{% wayback \"http://thetvdb.com\" %}}) for TV show data, although I’m generally unimpressed with the TV show artwork. For that, I use [Get Video Artwork]({{% wayback \"http://getvideoartwork.com\" %}}) and download the iTunes-compatible, square-shaped TV show artwork.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/subler-artwork.png\"\u003e}}\n\nWhile Subler does a good job of checking the right boxes automatically, you’ll want to check the *Other Settings* and make sure that the resolution and media kind are set correctly for your new `.m4v` file.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/subler-other.png\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Renaming\n\nI prefer to keep my video files sorted by `\u003cshow\u003e/\u003cseason\u003e/\u003cfile\u003e`. I also go so far to name my files as `S.E - Title.mp4` (e.g., a recent episode of *Supernatural* was labeled *8.15 - Man’s Best Friend with Benefits*).\n\nGoing episode-by-episode can be very tedious, so I wrote up a [Mac OS X service]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/rename-workflow.zip\" %}}) to handle this for me. The only prerequisite is to install a package called [mp4v2]({{% wayback \"https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/multimedia/mp4v2/Portfile\" %}}) from [MacPorts]({{% wayback \"http://macports.org\" %}}).\n\n```bash\nsudo port install mp4v2\n```\n\nOnce you’ve installed MacPorts (if you hadn’t already) and the **mp4v2** package, you can install the OS X service by double-clicking it. (It’s an Automator action, so feel free to take a look at what it does before installing it.)\n\nWith everything installed, you can now right-click on one or more video files, choose *Services*, then “Rename video to 1.01 - Title.mp4”.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/workflow.png\"\u003e}}\n\nWithin a few seconds, the Automator workflow will read the contents of the video file for the season number, episode number, and episode title, and rename the file automatically.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/mkv/done.png\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Streaming from iTunes\n\nI’ve already covered this in my [previous post](/2013/04/08/converting-blu-ray-and-dvd-movies-to-mp4-using-mac-os-x-for-playback-on-ipad-apple-tv-playstation-3-xbox-360-roku-and-other-players/), so I’m not going to go over it again here.\n\nOnce it’s in iTunes, you can sync shows to your smartphone, iPad, or stream them to a variety of devices throughout your home.\n"},

        "plain":"I often find myself wanting to watch my movies when I’m on-the-go, or sitting at work writing code. I also have one Blu-ray player in the house, and hate having to sit through one unskippable warning or commercial after another.   Because of this, I choose to exercise my fair-use right to format-shift my movies into something more convenient. Making a personal backup of movies you own is in a legal gray-area in the U.S. Historically, this sort of thing fell under fair use law, but the DMCA (1998) makes it illegal to crack the encryption. This is why backing-up CDs is commonplace while backing-up DVDs and Blu-rays is frowned upon. The encryption is where the line is drawn. You’ve been warned!\nHardware The Mac used for this tutorial is an 17\u0026rdquo; MacBook Pro (early–2011) with a 64-bit quad-core 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, OS X Mountain Lion, and a standard, built-in Superdrive. The external BD-R drive is a Buffalo MediaStation 6X USB 2.0 Portable Blu-Ray Writer.\nBacking-up your discs Pretty much every Mac since the early 2000s has shipped with a DVD drive, so these are easy to come by. For backing up personal DVDs so that they can be format-shifted, RipIt is highly recommended. A license is a paltry $25, and I recommend supporting the developers of this software. Backing up is as simple as inserting the DVD, launching RipIt, and choosing “Rip”. You can expect a rip to take 15–30 minutes, depending on the size of the disc.\n  For Blu-ray discs, you first need a Blu-ray drive. For backing up personal Blu-rays so that they can be format-shifted, MakeMKV is highly recommended. We won’t be making .mkv files, but it has support for backups. A license is somewhere in the $60-$80 range, and I recommend supporting the developers of this software. Backing up is as simple as inserting the Blu-ray disc, launching MakeMKV, and choosing “Backup”. You can expect a rip to take 45m–1h15m, depending on the size of the disc.\n  If you’re on Windows, check-out AnyDVD and AnyDVD HD.\nFormat-Shifting to MP4/H.264/AAC Video files are a lot more complicated than most people realize. You may have heard words like MKV, MPEG–4, AVI, MP3, AAC and other acronyms.\nThe short explanation is that every video file is made up of 3 different parts: the video stream, the audio stream, and the container. The audio and video are synced-up (a.k.a., “multiplexed” or “muxed”) and are bundled together into a single file using a container format.\nIf you want to make yourself a little more educated about this stuff, check out the \u0026ldquo;Video on the Web\u0026rdquo; chapter of Dive Into HTML5 by Mark Pilgrim. For this exercise, just know that we want to end up with an H.264 video stream and an AAC audio stream, wrapped up inside an MP4 container.\nFor this, we’ll use Handbrake. Handbrake will take our personal backups as input, and produce an .mp4 (or .m4v — same thing) file as output.\nHandbrake comes with a good set of default settings. If you don’t know what you’re doing, feel free to use those. I’ve tweaked my settings a bit as I prefer higher-quality files at the cost of a larger file size.\nSee the following screenshots for information on my presets.\n  DVD: Video, Audio, Subtitles, Advanced, and Chapters.\n  Blu-ray: Video, Audio, Subtitles, Advanced, and Chapters.\n  The biggest difference between these is that the video bitrate for DVDs is 3,000 kbps while for Blu-rays it’s 10,000 kbps.\nTo get started, click the Source button in the upper-left corner of the main Handbrake window. Find your backup directory, and choose Open. Handbrake will parse the files and make sure it has a complete backup to work with. If you’re using my presets, choose DVD (480p) if your source is a DVD backup, or Blu-ray (1080p) if your source is a Blu-ray backup. It may also be helpful to check out the Handbrake Quick-Start Guide if you’re new to the tool.\n  Next, click the Add to Queue button. Once you’ve queued-up all of the movies you want to format-shift, click the Start button. On the reference hardware listed above, DVDs typically take 45m–1h30m to fully encode a new MP4 file. Blu-rays take 4–6 hours. In both cases, Handbrake will leverage as much of your CPU and RAM as possible, so don’t expect to be able to do much with your computer until its done.\nWith these settings, expect a 480p MP4 to be around 1 GB/hour of video and a 1080p MP4 to be around 5 GB/hour of video. If having a 15 GB copy of Titanic is too much, lower the video bitrate for the Blu-ray (1080p) setting from 10,000 kbps. The lower the setting, the worse the quality, but the smaller the file size.\n  One more tip: 1080p video has a resolution of 1920×1080. The smaller the screen, the less there is for your eyes to notice, so you can be more forgiving of lower-quality. However, if you’re stretching 1920×1080 across your nice new 55\u0026rdquo; LED TV, a low-quality file will make your whole movie-watching experience suck. The bigger the TV, the better you want the quality to be.\nMetadata and Artwork Once you have your .mp4 or .m4v file, you’ll want to give it a proper name and add the metadata and artwork to the file. The format I use is \u0026lt;name of movie\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;format\u0026gt;).mp4 (e.g., My Favorite Movie (1080p).mp4).\nIt’s possible that you may have heard of AtomicParsley, MetaX or MetaZ before. They all suck. Check out Subler instead.\n  Subler queries The Movie DB for movie data and artwork, and uses TVDB for TV show data. While The Movie DB has a pretty awesome selection of movie artwork, I’m generally unimpressed with the TV show artwork. For that, I use Get Video Artwork and download the iTunes-compatible, square-shaped TV show artwork.\n  Save your changes, and Subler will write the video metadata and artwork into the file.\nStreaming via iTunes I have an Xbox 360, a Playstation 3, and two Apple TVs at home. I also have an iPad 2, iPad 3 and an iPad mini. Needless to say, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows.\nBecause the video files tend to be so large, I use an external hard drive attached to my Mac to store the video files. I then tell iTunes where to find the movie by option-dragging the MP4 file from Finder into iTunes’ Movie pane. The option-drag tells iTunes “here’s a pointer to the movie, but don’t copy it onto my built-in hard drive”.\n  Now it’s time to watch your movie!\n  As of iOS 5, iPad supports 1080p video. Simply sync the movie to your iPad and watch it on-the-go.\n  As long as your computer running iTunes and your Apple TV are on the same network and are both configured to use the same Home Sharing account, you should be able to start streaming the movie to your Apple TV right away. (I would always recommend a hard-wired network connection, otherwise a Wireless-N connection. A Wireless-G connection is likely going to require more buffering or have choppy playback.)\n  To stream to your Playstation 3, you’ll need to be running a DLNA server on your Mac. Medialink ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Playstation 3.\n  To stream to your Xbox 360, you’ll need to be running a similar server which the Xbox understands. Connect360 ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Xbox 360.\n  Since MP4/H.264/AAC is the industry-wide standard for all modern-age video, pretty much any smartphone, tablet, laptop, operating system, and streaming device created since 2004 can play this format out-of-the-box. Even ancient OS’s like Windows XP have been updated to support this format. Go nuts.\n  ",

We won’t be making `.mkv` files, but it has support for backups. A license is somewhere in the $60-$80 range, and I recommend supporting the developers of this software. Backing up is as simple as inserting the Blu-ray disc, launching MakeMKV, and choosing “Backup”. You can expect a rip to take 45m–1h15m, depending on the size of the disc.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-makemkv.png\"\u003e}}\n\nIf you’re on Windows, check-out [AnyDVD]({{% wayback \"http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvd.html\" %}}) and [AnyDVD HD]({{% wayback \"http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvdhd.html\" %}}).\n\n\n## Format-Shifting to MP4/H.264/AAC\n\nVideo files are a lot more complicated than most people realize. You may have heard words like MKV, MPEG–4, AVI, MP3, AAC and other acronyms.\n\nThe short explanation is that every video file is made up of **3 different parts**: the **video stream**, the **audio stream**, and the **container**. The audio and video are synced-up (a.k.a., “multiplexed” or “muxed”) and are bundled together into a single file using a container format.\n\nIf you want to make yourself a little more educated about this stuff, check out the \"[Video on the Web]({{% wayback \"http://diveintohtml5.info/video.html\" %}})\" chapter of *Dive Into HTML5* by Mark Pilgrim. For this exercise, just know that we want to end up with an **H.264** video stream and an **AAC** audio stream, wrapped up inside an **MP4** container.\n\nFor this, we’ll use [Handbrake]({{% wayback \"http://handbrake.fr\" %}}). Handbrake will take our personal backups as input, and produce an `.mp4` (or `.m4v` — same thing) file as output.\n\nHandbrake comes with a good set of default settings. If you don’t know what you’re doing, feel free to use those. I’ve tweaked my settings a bit as I prefer higher-quality files at the cost of a larger file size.\n\nSee the following screenshots for information on my presets.\n\n* **DVD:** [Video]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-video.png\" %}}), [Audio]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-audio.png\" %}}), [Subtitles]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-subtitles.png\" %}}), [Advanced]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-advanced.png\" %}}), and [Chapters]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/dvd-chapters.png\" %}}).\n\n* **Blu-ray:** [Video]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-video.png\" %}}), [Audio]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-audio.png\" %}}), [Subtitles]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-subtitles.png\" %}}), [Advanced]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-advanced.png\" %}}), and [Chapters]({{% wayback \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/bluray-chapters.png\" %}}).\n\nThe biggest difference between these is that the video bitrate for DVDs is 3,000 kbps while for Blu-rays it’s 10,000 kbps.\n\nTo get started, click the *Source* button in the upper-left corner of the main Handbrake window. Find your backup directory, and choose *Open*. Handbrake will parse the files and make sure it has a complete backup to work with. If you’re using my presets, choose *DVD (480p)* if your source is a DVD backup, or *Blu-ray (1080p)* if your source is a Blu-ray backup. It may also be helpful to check out the [Handbrake Quick-Start Guide]({{% wayback \"https://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/MacGuiGuide\" %}}) if you’re new to the tool.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/handbrake-source.png\"\u003e}}\n\nNext, click the *Add to Queue* button. Once you’ve queued-up all of the movies you want to format-shift, click the *Start* button. On the reference hardware listed above, DVDs typically take 45m–1h30m to fully encode a new MP4 file. Blu-rays take 4–6 hours. In both cases, Handbrake will leverage as much of your CPU and RAM as possible, so don’t expect to be able to do much with your computer until its done.\n\nWith these settings, expect a **480p** MP4 to be around **1 GB/hour** of video and a **1080p** MP4 to be around **5 GB/hour** of video. If having a 15 GB copy of *Titanic* is too much, lower the video bitrate for the *Blu-ray (1080p)* setting from 10,000 kbps. The lower the setting, the worse the quality, but the smaller the file size.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/titanic.png\"\u003e}}\n\n**One more tip:** 1080p video has a resolution of `1920×1080`. The smaller the screen, the less there is for your eyes to notice, so you can be more forgiving of lower-quality. However, if you’re stretching `1920×1080` across your nice new 55\" LED TV, a low-quality file will make your whole movie-watching experience suck. The bigger the TV, the better you want the quality to be.\n\n\n## Metadata and Artwork\n\nOnce you have your `.mp4` or `.m4v` file, you’ll want to give it a proper name and add the metadata and artwork to the file. The format I use is `\u003cname of movie\u003e (\u003cformat\u003e).mp4` (e.g., `My Favorite Movie (1080p).mp4`).\n\nIt’s possible that you may have heard of *AtomicParsley*, *MetaX* or *MetaZ* before. They all suck. Check out [Subler]({{% wayback \"http://code.google.com/p/subler/\" %}}) instead.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/subler-metadata.png\"\u003e}}\n\nSubler queries [The Movie DB]({{% wayback \"http://themoviedb.org\" %}}) for movie data and artwork, and uses [TVDB]({{% wayback \"http://thetvdb.com\" %}}) for TV show data. While The Movie DB has a pretty awesome selection of movie artwork, I’m generally unimpressed with the TV show artwork. For that, I use [Get Video Artwork]({{% wayback \"http://getvideoartwork.com\" %}}) and download the iTunes-compatible, square-shaped TV show artwork.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/subler-artwork.png\"\u003e}}\n\nSave your changes, and Subler will write the video metadata and artwork into the file.\n\n\n## Streaming via iTunes\n\nI have an Xbox 360, a Playstation 3, and two Apple TVs at home. I also have an iPad 2, iPad 3 and an iPad mini. Needless to say, I watch a lot of movies and TV shows.\n\nBecause the video files tend to be so large, I use an external hard drive attached to my Mac to store the video files. I then tell iTunes where to find the movie by *option-dragging* the MP4 file from Finder into iTunes’ *Movie* pane. The *option-drag* tells iTunes “here’s a pointer to the movie, but don’t copy it onto my built-in hard drive”.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/blu-ray/itunes.png\"\u003e}}\n\nNow it’s time to watch your movie!\n\n1. As of iOS 5, **iPad** supports 1080p video. Simply sync the movie to your iPad and watch it on-the-go.\n\n2. As long as your computer running iTunes and your **Apple TV** are on the same network and are both configured to use the same *Home Sharing* account, you should be able to start streaming the movie to your Apple TV right away. (I would always recommend a hard-wired network connection, otherwise a Wireless-N connection. A Wireless-G connection is likely going to require more buffering or have choppy playback.)\n\n3. To stream to your **Playstation 3**, you’ll need to be running a [DLNA]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance\" %}}) server on your Mac. [Medialink]({{% wayback \"http://www.nullriver.com/products/medialink\" %}}) ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Playstation 3.\n\n4. To stream to your **Xbox 360**, you’ll need to be running a similar server which the Xbox understands. [Connect360]({{% wayback \"http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360\" %}}) ($20) can be installed as a System Preference and automatically serve your iTunes content to your Xbox 360.\n\n5. Since MP4/H.264/AAC is the industry-wide *standard* for all modern-age video, pretty much any smartphone, tablet, laptop, operating system, and streaming device created since 2004 can play this format out-of-the-box. Even ancient OS’s like Windows XP have been updated to support this format. Go nuts.\n"},
