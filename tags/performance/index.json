At first we told users that the feeds were broken — which they were. But then we started getting enough reports that we decided to do something about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"introducing-xpath\"\u003eIntroducing XPath\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast-forward to the summer of 2017 when I started work on SimplePie NG in earnest. There are a number of things I’m doing differently (read: better) this time around. The first is that the \u003cem\u003efastest\u003c/em\u003e approach is the \u003cem\u003edefault\u003c/em\u003e approach. A corollary to this principle is that if you want to do more things, you will pay for them with performance penalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my time working at Amazon Web Services on the SDK for PHP, I discovered some substantial performance gains by moving a lot of the response-parsing code to XPath. As such, the core XML parsing in SimplePie NG is all built around \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://secure.php.net/domdocument\"\u003eDOMDocument\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://secure.php.net/domxpath\"\u003eXPath\u003c/a\u003e queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo solve this case-insensitivity problem, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2893551/case-insensitive-matching-in-xpath\"\u003esearching Stack Overflow for “case insensitive xpath”\u003c/a\u003e tells you about the XPath 2.0 functions \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-matches\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ematches()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-lower-case\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003elower-case()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. However, I was surprised to learn that PHP only supports XPath 1.0. After doing some digging, the reason appears to be that the underlying \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/http://xmlsoft.org\"\u003elibxml2\u003c/a\u003e library only supports XPath 1.0, with \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2007-February/msg00077.html\"\u003eno updated support on the horizon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only alternative that Google and Stack Overflow had for me was the XPath 1.0 function, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-translate\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In PHP, the case-insensitive query for the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;rss\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e element would be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-php\" data-lang=\"php\"\u003e/*[translate(name(), \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u0026#39;) = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39;]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s simple enough to turn this into a pattern inside of a function. Case-insensitive XML parsing. Done. Boo-yah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"performance-testing\"\u003ePerformance-testing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little while later, I started some early work on benchmarking SimplePie NG. I parsed a number of normal-sized feeds, and got back a bunch of perfectly reasonable results. But one thing that I wanted to test was memory usage to make sure there were no memory leaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put together a quick and dirty test suite by starting with Tim Bray’s feed (one of the more nuanced and complex Atom 1.0 feeds), \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng/master/tests/Integration/feeds/full/atom10/tim-bray-500.xml\"\u003eduplicating the entries to a total of 500\u003c/a\u003e (increasing the size to around 3 MB), and then \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/atom10.php\"\u003ewrote a test that flexed everything\u003c/a\u003e about SimplePie NG that I could think of. I then started running the test over and over again, collecting data about the timing and memory usage, and when the cache kicks-in and the engine warms up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"test-machine-and-environment\"\u003eTest machine and environment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m running this on a \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\"\u003e2011 “Core i7” MacBook Pro\u003c/a\u003e, with 16 GB of RAM and an after-market SATA-III SSD. I have various background processes running, so it isn’t the same as running it on a fresh Linux web server. I also have \u003cem\u003eXDebug\u003c/em\u003e enabled, and I’m testing on the CLI where \u003cem\u003eZend OpCache\u003c/em\u003e is disabled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"first-pass-case-insensitive-with-xpath-translate\"\u003eFirst pass; Case-insensitive with XPath translate()\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intial results for this 3 MB, 500-entry feed — with case-insensitivity enabled by way of the XPath \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e function — had an average runtime of \u003cstrong\u003e26 seconds\u003c/strong\u003e. That was \u003cem\u003equite\u003c/em\u003e a bit slower than I was hoping for (especially on PHP 7.2), but then again it \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e a big file with \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of entries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s compare to case-insensitivity turned off (i.e., case-sensitive XML parsing).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"second-pass-normal-case-sensitive\"\u003eSecond pass; Normal, case-sensitive\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next round of results on the same 3 MB, 500-entry feed—with standard case-sensitive XPath queries—had an average runtime of \u003cstrong\u003e3.5 seconds\u003c/strong\u003e. That’s \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do some quick math, the normal query took only \u003cstrong\u003e14%\u003c/strong\u003e of the amount of time it took to do a case-insensitive query. Or, put another way, the case-insensitive query took around \u003cstrong\u003e7.5×\u003c/strong\u003e longer than the normal query. \u003cem\u003eThat’s awful!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"experimentation\"\u003eExperimentation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to find a way to improve the performance of the case-insensitive XPath query. Could I reduce the number of times I had to call \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"xslt\"\u003eXSLT\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried experimenting with XSLT for a few days. The goal was to transform the XML \u003cem\u003eonce\u003c/em\u003e with XSLT into a new XML document where all elements were lowercase, then I could just use regular XPath queries and avoid \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e all-together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I still think this is a fantastic idea if \u003cem\u003eyou know where your XML data is coming from\u003c/em\u003e. Unfortunately for me, I don’t, and I was completely unable to craft an appropriate XSLT template that would allow me to convert all tag names to lowercase without breaking a bunch of other things (e.g., entities). I ended up having to abandon this path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"enabling-php-functions-in-xpath\"\u003eEnabling PHP functions in XPath\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only dabbled with this briefly, but there was no discernable performance improvement that I can recall. Also, the PHP documentation is lacking around this feature, so it was a lot of trial and error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"simplify-translate\"\u003eSimplify translate()\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I wondered if I could reduce the amount of time that \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e takes if I simply gave it less work to do.

        "plain":"TL;DR: How I improved the performance of case-insensitive XPath queries by 30–35%, reducing an 8× performance hit to only 4.5–5×. This was originally posted to the SimplePie NG blog.\n   Parse-at-all-costs Most feeds are a mess. The old SimplePie “OG” took a parse-at-all-costs philosophy, and could handle many of the most broken feeds you could find — at a cost. While the early versions of SimplePie supported the letter of the RSS 2.0 specification, there were a surprising number of feeds which didn’t.\nOnce SimplePie started to get popular (2006–2008), we started getting bug reports from users who were working with RSS feeds containing elements such as \u0026lt;pubdate\u0026gt; (instead of \u0026lt;pubDate\u0026gt;) and \u0026lt;managingeditor\u0026gt; (instead of \u0026lt;managingEditor\u0026gt;). At first we told users that the feeds were broken — which they were. But then we started getting enough reports that we decided to do something about it.\nIntroducing XPath Fast-forward to the summer of 2017 when I started work on SimplePie NG in earnest. There are a number of things I’m doing differently (read: better) this time around. The first is that the fastest approach is the default approach. A corollary to this principle is that if you want to do more things, you will pay for them with performance penalties.\nDuring my time working at Amazon Web Services on the SDK for PHP, I discovered some substantial performance gains by moving a lot of the response-parsing code to XPath. As such, the core XML parsing in SimplePie NG is all built around DOMDocument and XPath queries.\nTo solve this case-insensitivity problem, searching Stack Overflow for “case insensitive xpath” tells you about the XPath 2.0 functions matches() and lower-case(). However, I was surprised to learn that PHP only supports XPath 1.0. After doing some digging, the reason appears to be that the underlying libxml2 library only supports XPath 1.0, with no updated support on the horizon.\nThe only alternative that Google and Stack Overflow had for me was the XPath 1.0 function, translate(). In PHP, the case-insensitive query for the \u0026lt;rss\u0026gt; element would be:\n/*[translate(name(), \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u0026#39;) = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39;] It’s simple enough to turn this into a pattern inside of a function. Case-insensitive XML parsing. Done. Boo-yah.\nPerformance-testing A little while later, I started some early work on benchmarking SimplePie NG. I parsed a number of normal-sized feeds, and got back a bunch of perfectly reasonable results. But one thing that I wanted to test was memory usage to make sure there were no memory leaks.\nI put together a quick and dirty test suite by starting with Tim Bray’s feed (one of the more nuanced and complex Atom 1.0 feeds), duplicating the entries to a total of 500 (increasing the size to around 3 MB), and then wrote a test that flexed everything about SimplePie NG that I could think of. I then started running the test over and over again, collecting data about the timing and memory usage, and when the cache kicks-in and the engine warms up.\nTest machine and environment I’m running this on a 2011 “Core i7” MacBook Pro, with 16 GB of RAM and an after-market SATA-III SSD. I have various background processes running, so it isn’t the same as running it on a fresh Linux web server. I also have XDebug enabled, and I’m testing on the CLI where Zend OpCache is disabled.\nFirst pass; Case-insensitive with XPath translate() The intial results for this 3 MB, 500-entry feed — with case-insensitivity enabled by way of the XPath translate() function — had an average runtime of 26 seconds. That was quite a bit slower than I was hoping for (especially on PHP 7.2), but then again it was a big file with a lot of entries.\nLet’s compare to case-insensitivity turned off (i.e., case-sensitive XML parsing).\nSecond pass; Normal, case-sensitive The next round of results on the same 3 MB, 500-entry feed—with standard case-sensitive XPath queries—had an average runtime of 3.5 seconds. That’s a lot better.\nTo do some quick math, the normal query took only 14% of the amount of time it took to do a case-insensitive query. Or, put another way, the case-insensitive query took around 7.5× longer than the normal query. That’s awful!\nExperimentation I had to find a way to improve the performance of the case-insensitive XPath query. Could I reduce the number of times I had to call translate()?\nXSLT I tried experimenting with XSLT for a few days. The goal was to transform the XML once with XSLT into a new XML document where all elements were lowercase, then I could just use regular XPath queries and avoid translate() all-together.\nOverall, I still think this is a fantastic idea if you know where your XML data is coming from. Unfortunately for me, I don’t, and I was completely unable to craft an appropriate XSLT template that would allow me to convert all tag names to lowercase without breaking a bunch of other things (e.g., entities). I ended up having to abandon this path.\nEnabling PHP functions in XPath I only dabbled with this briefly, but there was no discernable performance improvement that I can recall. Also, the PHP documentation is lacking around this feature, so it was a lot of trial and error.\nSimplify translate() Finally, I wondered if I could reduce the amount of time that translate() takes if I simply gave it less work to do. Instead of giving it the entire alphabet, what if I only gave it the letters that were in the XML element name?\nPHP has a function count_chars() that can return the unique characters in a string. From here, we can create upper and lower-case versions of the string, and just use those in the translate() function.\n\u0026lt;?php $word = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39;; $elementLetters = \\count_chars($word, 3); $lettersLower = \\mb_strtolower($elementLetters); $lettersUpper = \\mb_strtoupper($elementLetters); $query = \\sprintf( \u0026#39;/*[translate(name(), \\\u0026#39;%s\\\u0026#39;, \\\u0026#39;%s\\\u0026#39;) = \\\u0026#39;%s\\\u0026#39;]\u0026#39;, $lettersUpper, $lettersLower, $word ); # /*[translate(name(), \u0026#39;RS\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rs\u0026#39;) = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39; $results = $domxpath-\u0026gt;query($query); Testing this approach on the same 3 MB, 500-entry feed — with case-insensitivity enabled by way of our smarter translate() function — had an average runtime of 17 seconds.\nRunning the same benchmarks against my other test feeds consistently showed a 30–35% improvement in performance when using only the required letters in the translate() function instead of the entire alphabet.\nWrapping-up Even with this technique (on this particular set of data, with this particular testing approach), case-insensitive queries are still 4.5–5× slower than their case-sensitive counterparts.
