        "plain":"I take password security very seriously. I’ve already written about how people can improve their password habits to keep themselves safe. This piece, however, is for those of you who build websites which provide password-related functionality.   This is a list of password crimes that some websites commit. I’ve described these crimes, then point out some criminals (a.k.a., websites) which commit these crimes.\n(This list is not guaranteed to continue to be up-to-date. This post represents a snapshot in time, and is accurate as of early June 2014 when the first draft of this post was written.)\nBasic usability   I should always be able to change my password from within my user preferences. If I have to log out and pretend like I’ve forgotten my password in order to change it, your system is broken. (Authy, TunnelBear)\n  If anything with your site or service requires a password, always allow me to change it from the web — even if changing my password is the only thing I can do. (Automatic, Zite, Steam)\n  Make it super-easy to find where to change my password. Do not bury the link to make it more difficult. (LinkedIn)\n  If my password change was successful, please tell me very clearly. If not, please tell me very clearly. (Last.fm, Disqus, Bible.com)\n  Provide clarity at all times   If you require my current password in order to change my password, then ask for it up-front. Don’t hide it, then surprise me. Don’t ask for it after I’ve put in my new password. Be direct and forthcoming about it. (Kickstarter, CloudApp, Spotify)\n  Be explicitly clear about what the password requirements are. Not just the low-end — make sure you document the high-end requirements too. I often run into cases where my passwords are too secure for the system. (Morgan Stanley, Life 360, H\u0026amp;R Block, Zendesk, Beatport, Secure Checkout by Visa)\n  If you wait until after I try to change my password to tell me how long it’s allowed to be, you’re a huge jerk. (H\u0026amp;R Block, MyFitnessPal, SourceForge, Secure Checkout by Visa)\n  If my password is too long, don’t complain that it’s too short and not tell me the maximum allowable length. (Beats Music)\n  If you list your password requirements on your website for people to use, make sure that the ones you list are actually correct. (Morgan Stanley, Secure Checkout by Visa)\n  Avoid confusion     If I’ve managed to inadvertently create two accounts, make it easy for me to merge them. If you suck, and require me to delete one of them, then actually delete the account. (Adobe, Readability, Facebook)\n  Never allow two accounts to have the same email address, then allow users to login with their email address. There is a 100% chance that this will ruin someone’s day. (Readability, Amazon Web Services)\n  Provide a useful “forgot password” page   On the “forgot password” page, always allow me to enter my email address. I may not always know some random username, but I will always know my email address. If I try to look-up my password and you ask for a username (i.e., lookup by email address is not supported), then make me go to another lookup for my username, your system is broken. Support both if possible, otherwise err on the side of email address. (Pottermore)\n  If your password change/reset form(s) accepts my new password, then the login page should too. If my password doesn’t pass validation for logging in, then it shouldn’t pass when I change it via account preferences or the “forgot password” page. (Morgan Stanley)\n  Be liberal in what you accept   Never tell me that an email address with the “+” character is invalid. Yes it is. You’re dumb, you’re ugly, and your mother never loved you.\n  You shouldn’t be storing my real password, ever. You should only be storing a cryptographic hash of my password for comparison. (Never use MD5 and never use SHA–1. You should be using SHA–256 at minimum, which is 64 hexadecimal digits long.) Because of this, the following principles should always be true.\n  Accept any password I give you, and be happy about it. Even if it’s 128 consecutive NULL bytes, or a long string of multi-byte characters, accept it gladly. Chances are, I’m smarter than your system, so allow me to be. (Anyone who limits supported characters.)\n  If you accept only certain “special characters” (a.k.a., “characters” — none are “special”), be explicitly clear which ones they are. If I try to use “£” in my password, but it isn’t allowed, tell me: “Your password contains the ‘£’ character, which is not allowed.” (Usability bonus)\n  If you have a length limit on passwords, the string limit should be no smaller than 64 bytes. Yes, 64 bytes. The next bank (or other service) to tell me that my password may only be 5–12 alphanumeric characters is going to immediately lose my business. (Life 360)\n    Support OAuth consistently, or not at all     If you allow me to sign-up/log-in to the desktop version of the website with Facebook (or any other OAuth provider), then you must always have that login option available everywhere else (e.g., mobile web, native mobile app, being an OAuth provider, asking for my password to change my password). I don’t have a password otherwise.\n  If I create an account with Facebook, then go to the mobile app and can’t login without a first-party password, I’m screwed. (TripIt)\n  If I then try to add (change) my password, but I have to know my current (imaginary) password before “changing” it to add one, I’m also screwed. (Engadget, Beatport)\n    Real security, not “Security Theater”   Instead of asking me random/stupid “security questions”, give me the option of using two-factor authentication. It’s more secure and easier to use. (Pretty much every bank and financial institution on the planet.)\n  If your second factor is SMS, fine. Not great, but fine. (Twitter, Etsy)\n  Even better is to support Authy, Google Authenticator, or an RSA key fob token as the second-factor authentication mechanism.\n    Don’t break the web   Never prevent me from copy-pasting my password. I use a password manager so that I don’t have to remember it, you pretentious prick. (Paypal)\n  Understand that an increasing number of people are using password managers. This is a very good thing. This also means (a) the username and password fields should always maintain the same HTML field name, (b) if you change the URL, the old URL should redirect to the new one — especially if you’ve changed the login domain.

        "plain":"I didn’t know Aaron personally, so there’s no insight I can provide into the person who I’ve read people describe as “a brilliant soul”.\n  The world is now a worse place The tech world is abuzz with the news that, at only 26 years old, Aaron Swartz decided to take his own life. I heard about it last night when I opened up Tweetbot, and saw two tweets back-to-back in my timeline:\n@al3x :\n We lost @aaronsw. — Alex Payne (@al3x) January 12, 2013.\n @dcurtis :\n Fuck. tech.mit.edu/V132/N61/swart…The world is now a worse place. — dustin curtis (@dcurtis) January 12, 2013.\n RSS Being part of the web world, I certainly knew Aaron by reputation. I first heard about him back when I started tinkering with RSS in 2003. While I may have started a project that simplified RSS for a legion of PHP developers, Aaron literally wrote the spec — and at 14 years old, I might add.\nCory Doctorow had this to say:\n I met Aaron when he was 14 or 15. He was working on XML stuff (he co-wrote the RSS specification when he was 14) and came to San Francisco often, and would stay with Lisa Rein , a friend of mine who was also an XML person and who took care of him and assured his parents he had adult supervision. In so many ways, he was an adult, even then, with a kind of intense, fast intellect that really made me feel like he was part and parcel of the Internet society, like he belonged in the place where your thoughts are what matter, and not who you are or how old you are.\n Creative Commons. PACER. Demand Progress.   Every so often throughout the last decade, his name would pop-up around topics that I was also interested in. Creative Commons. Opening up public access to court records. Demand Progress. He used technology to fight for the same sorts of causes that I fight for, evangelize for, or are otherwise close to my heart. Namely:\n  the over-criminalization of American citizens by its government, and…\n  the fact that the people we elect to represent us in government would throw us under the bus in a heartbeat if it meant more money, power and political cachet.\n  Cory Doctorow continues:\n At one point, he singlehandedly liberated 20 percent of US law. PACER, the system that gives Americans access to their own (public domain) case-law, charged a fee for each such access. After activists built RECAP (which allowed its users to put any caselaw they paid for into a free/public repository), Aaron spent a small fortune fetching a titanic amount of data and putting it into the public domain. The feds hated this. They smeared him, the FBI investigated him, and for a while, it looked like he’d be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff, but he escaped it all, and emerged triumphant.\n Aaron was involved in the creation of an organization called Demand Progress, who “works to win progressive policy changes for ordinary people through organizing, and grassroots lobbying. In particular, we tend to focus on issues of civil liberties, civil rights, and government reform.”\nIt was here where I first learned about the Senate’s proposed PROTECT-IP Act (later renamed “PIPA”), and it’s House sibling, the ill-fated SOPA Act, whose negative repercussions would have been felt for generations to come.\nDownload too much, go to jail From a New York Times article dated July 19, 2011:\n Demand Progress said on its site that it appeared Mr. Swartz was “being charged with allegedly downloading too many scholarly journal articles from the Web.” It quoted the group’s executive director, David Segal, as saying, “It’s like trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.”\n Cory Doctorow:\n Aaron snuck into MIT and planted a laptop in a utility closet, used it to download a lot of journal articles (many in the public domain), and then snuck in and retrieved it. This sort of thing is pretty par for the course around MIT, and though Aaron wasn’t an MIT student, he was a fixture in the Cambridge hacker scene, and associated with Harvard, and generally part of that gang, and Aaron hadn’t done anything with the articles (yet), so it seemed likely that it would just fizzle out. Instead, they threw the book at him. Even though MIT and JSTOR (the journal publisher) backed down, the prosecution kept on. I heard lots of theories: the feds who’d tried unsuccessfully to nail him for the PACER/RECAP stunt had a serious hate-on for him; the feds were chasing down all the Cambridge hackers who had any connection to Bradley Manning in the hopes of turning one of them, and other, less credible theories. A couple of lawyers close to the case told me that they thought Aaron would go to jail.\n And Larry Lessig:\n But all this shows is that if the government proved its case, some punishment was appropriate. So what was that appropriate punishment? Was Aaron a terrorist? Or a cracker trying to profit from stolen goods? Or was this something completely different? Early on, and to its great credit, JSTOR figured “appropriate” out: They declined to pursue their own action against Aaron, and they asked the government to drop its. MIT, to its great shame, was not as clear, and so the prosecutor had the excuse he needed to continue his war against the “criminal” who we who loved him knew as Aaron.\n And an article from September by Tim Cushing from TechDirt:\n Swartz, the executive director of Demand Progress, was charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a catch-all designation for “computer activity the US government doesn’t like.” Swartz had accessed MIT’s computer network to download a large number of files from JSTOR, a non-profit that hosts academic journal articles. US prosecutors claimed he “stole” several thousand files, but considering MIT offered this access for free on campus (and the files being digital), it’s pretty tough to square his massive downloading with any idea of “theft.”\n Prosecutor as bully   Larry Lessig continues (reformatted paragraphs, mine):\n Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior.\nFrom the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of ACADEMIC ARTICLES is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.\nAaron had literally done nothing in his life “to make money.” He was fortunate Reddit turned out as it did, but from his work building the RSS standard, to his work architecting Creative Commons, to his work liberating public records, to his work building a free public library, to his work supporting Change Congress/FixCongressFirst/Rootstrikers, and then Demand Progress, Aaron was always and only working for (at least his conception of) the public good. He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?\nThat person is gone today, driven to the edge by what a decent society would only call bullying. I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government [against] you. For remember, we live in a world where the architects of the financial crisis regularly dine at the White House — and where even those brought to “justice” never even have to admit any wrongdoing, let alone be labeled “felons.”\n And again from TechDirt:\n There are now 13 felony counts in the new indictment, derived from claims of multiple instances of breaking those four laws. In specific:\n Wire Fraud - 2 counts Computer Fraud - 5 counts Unlawfully Obtaining Information from a Protected Computer - 5 counts Recklessly Damaging a Protected Computer - 1 count  It’s beyond my pay grade to figure out how many years in prison that all could be, when taking into account the complexities of sentencing law. Let’s leave it at a large scary number. Enough to ruin someone’s life.\n And the kicker…\n So, how do the new charges stack up in terms of a sentence? Tough to say.

He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more.\n From the post \u0026ldquo;My Aaron Swartz, whom I loved.,\u0026rdquo; by Quinn Norton:\n He loved my daughter so much it filled the room like a mist. He was transported playing with her, and she bored right into his heart. In his darkest moments, which I couldn’t reach him, Ada could still touch him, even if only for a moment. And when he was in the light, my god. I couldn’t keep up with either of them. I would hang back and watch them spring and play and laugh, and be so grateful for them both.\n Expert witness Alex Stamos, in \u0026ldquo;The Truth about Aaron Swartz’s ‘Crime’\u0026quot;:\n In short, Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not pose a real danger to JSTOR, MIT or the public. He was an intelligent young man who found a loophole that would allow him to download a lot of documents quickly. This loophole was created intentionally by MIT and JSTOR, and was codified contractually in the piles of paperwork turned over during discovery.\nIf I had taken the stand as planned and had been asked by the prosecutor whether Aaron’s actions were “wrong”, I would probably have replied that what Aaron did would better be described as “inconsiderate”. In the same way it is inconsiderate to write a check at the supermarket while a dozen people queue up behind you or to check out every book at the library needed for a History 101 paper. It is inconsiderate to download lots of files on shared wifi or to spider Wikipedia too quickly, but none of these actions should lead to a young person being hounded for years and haunted by the possibility of a 35 year sentence.\n Update (2013–01–20) I’ve continued to add to the links below as I’ve come across them, but a few more interesting things are beginning to shake-out from Aaron’s prosecution.\nScott Horton from Harper’s Magazine writes (Emphasis mine):\n U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz is fighting to hold on to her job, and to avoid an embarrassing grilling in Congress and possible professional disciplinary proceedings. Her prospects look grim. Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.), chair of the House Committee on Oversight is pledging a vigorous and critical inquiry into her management of the dubious criminal prosecution of Aaron Swartz, one of the greatest computer prodigies of his generation, who committed suicide a week ago, apparently convinced that out-of-control prosecutors had destroyed his life. […]\nAt funeral services in Highland Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, Swartz’s father charged that his son had been “killed by the government.” While some might ascribe this to the anguish of a bereaved father, scholars and investigators poring over the record of the Swartz prosecution are increasingly shocked at the scope and outrageousness of the prosecutorial misconduct that he faced. […]\nAlthough each of these counts bordered on the preposterous, Ortiz and Heymann clearly reckoned that at least one or two would stick during the jury-room bargaining process. More to the point, they assumed that the risk of their success even on bogus charges would be enough to pressure Swartz into accepting a guilty plea on all the counts in exchange for a reduced sentence — which is what they offered him. The process was fundamentally corrupt and shameful. But observers of the American criminal-justice system also know that it was a common one.\n I first learned about this corrupt little trick, long-since leveraged by federal prosecutors, when my best-friend-since-childhood made a stupid mistake one evening that was technically a felony offense — he viewed a 30-second video clip of somebody else committing a felony.\nThis is the same thing that police do when they’re investigating a bank robbery. The same thing that news anchors do when they show a security tape of people smashing through the front-doors of an Apple Store to steal iPads, “more at eleven”. Had he walked by and seen it happening through a window, he wouldn’t have been prosecuted. But he saw a half-minute recording and they threw the book at him. It’s very much like how prostitution is illegal, but if you record the act, suddenly it becomes porn. Perfectly legal.\n50 hours of community service would have been plenty to correct the mistake he made and make him pay more attention to his actions in the future. Instead, trumped-up charges by federal prosecutors resulted in him being sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary, followed by 5 years under probation, and another 15–20 years on the Sex Offender Registry living as a social pariah.\n(Studies by the U.S. Justice Department and other organizations show that recidivism rates are significantly lower for convicted sex offenders than for burglars, robbers, thieves, drug offenders and other convicts.)\nHe lost his home, his career, many of his friends, and because of his registry status he can’t find work — all because he made a stupid mistake. He’s doing everything he possibly can to re-assimilate back into society, but society doesn’t want him. His life was ruined. Fortunately, he’s smart, well-spoken and a hard worker. He was able to start two companies and is able to provide for his wife and 3 children. One of those companies is dedicated to helping people who were likewise abused by the federal justice system and have experienced the injustice of the Bureau of Prisons.\nBut I digress…\nTimothy B. Lee, from Ars Technica, follows-up on Aaron’s Law:\n On Tuesday, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) took to the pages of reddit to introduce legislation she dubbed “Aaron’s Law.” Lofgren’s bill would modify the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the basis for Swartz’s prosecution, to clarify that its definition of unauthorized access “does not include access in violation of an agreement or contractual obligation, such as an acceptable use policy or terms of service agreement, with an Internet service provider, Internet website, or employer.” It would make a similar change to the wire fraud statute.\nThe language was praised by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, a friend of Swartz whose wife organized his legal defense fund. “This is a CRITICALLY important change that would do incredible good,” Lessig wrote on reddit. “The CFAA was the hook for the government’s bullying of @aaronsw. This law would remove that hook.”\n More links…  A Chat with Aaron Swartz (Blogoscoped) Raw Thought: The Weblog of Aaron Swartz in Markdown, PDF, and ePub (GitHub) Carmen Ortiz Strikes Out (Harper’s) Still More About The Death Of Aaron Swartz (Esquire) How the Legal System Failed Aaron Swartz (The New Yorker) Darrell Issa Probing Prosecution Of Aaron Swartz, Internet Pioneer Who Killed Himself (Huffington Post) Lawmakers slam DOJ prosecution of Swartz as ‘ridiculous, absurd’ (The Hill) Did Prosecutors Go Too Far In Swartz Case?

I heard about it last night when I opened up Tweetbot, and saw two tweets back-to-back in my timeline:\n\n{{\u003c twitter al3x \u003e}}:\n\n\u003e We lost @[aaronsw]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/aaronsw\" %}}). — {{\u003c person name=\"Alex Payne\" url=\"https://twitter.com/al3x\" \u003e}} (@al3x) [January 12, 2013]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/al3x/status/290008536241565696\" %}}).\n\n{{\u003c twitter dcurtis \u003e}}:\n\n\u003e Fuck.

I first heard about him back when I started tinkering with RSS in 2003. While I [may have started a project that simplified RSS for a legion of PHP developers]({{% wayback \"http://simplepie.org\" %}}), Aaron literally wrote the spec — and at 14 years old, I might add.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Cory Doctorow\" \u003e}} [had this to say]({{% wayback \"http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e I met Aaron when he was 14 or 15. He was working on XML stuff (he co-wrote the RSS specification when he was 14) and came to San Francisco often, and would stay with {{\u003c person name=\"Lisa Rein\" \u003e}}, a friend of mine who was also an XML person and who took care of him and assured his parents he had adult supervision. In so many ways, he was an adult, even then, with a kind of intense, fast intellect that really made me feel like he was part and parcel of the Internet society, like he belonged in the place where your thoughts are what matter, and not who you are or how old you are.\n\n## Creative Commons. PACER. Demand Progress.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/demand-progress@2x.png\"\u003e}}\n\nEvery so often throughout the last decade, his name would pop-up around topics that I was also interested in. [Creative Commons]({{% wayback \"http://creativecommons.org\" %}}). Opening up [public access to court records]({{% wayback \"https://www.recapthelaw.org\" %}}). [Demand Progress]({{% wayback \"http://demandprogress.org\" %}}). He used technology to fight for the same sorts of causes that I fight for, evangelize for, or are otherwise close to my heart. *Namely:*\n\n* the over-criminalization of American citizens by its government, and…\n\n* the fact that the people we elect to represent us in government would throw us under the bus in a heartbeat if it meant more money, power and political cachet.\n\nCory Doctorow continues:\n\n\u003e At one point, he singlehandedly liberated 20 percent of US law. PACER, the system that gives Americans access to their own (public domain) case-law, charged a fee for each such access. After activists built RECAP (which allowed its users to put any caselaw they paid for into a free/public repository), Aaron spent a small fortune fetching a titanic amount of data and putting it into the public domain. The feds hated this. They smeared him, the FBI investigated him, and for a while, it looked like he’d be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff, but he escaped it all, and emerged triumphant.\n\nAaron was involved in the creation of an organization called [Demand Progress]({{% wayback \"http://demandprogress.org\" %}}), who *“works to win progressive policy changes for ordinary people through organizing, and grassroots lobbying. In particular, we tend to focus on issues of civil liberties, civil rights, and government reform.”*\n\nIt was here where I first learned about the Senate’s proposed [PROTECT-IP Act]({{% wayback \"http://www.fightforthefuture.org/pipa/\" %}}) (later renamed “PIPA”), and it’s House sibling, the ill-fated [SOPA Act]({{% wayback \"http://sopastrike.com\" %}}), whose negative repercussions would have been felt for *generations* to come.\n\n## Download too much, go to jail\n\nFrom a [New York Times article dated July 19, 2011]({{% wayback \"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/reddit-co-founder-charged-with-data-theft/?pagewanted=all\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Demand Progress said on its site that it appeared Mr. Swartz was “being charged with allegedly downloading too many scholarly journal articles from the Web.” It quoted the group’s executive director, David Segal, as saying, “It’s like trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.”\n\nCory Doctorow:\n\n\u003e Aaron snuck into MIT and planted a laptop in a utility closet, used it to download a lot of journal articles (many in the public domain), and then snuck in and retrieved it. This sort of thing is pretty par for the course around MIT, and though Aaron wasn’t an MIT student, he was a fixture in the Cambridge hacker scene, and associated with Harvard, and generally part of that gang, and Aaron hadn’t done anything with the articles (yet), so it seemed likely that it would just fizzle out. Instead, they threw the book at him. Even though MIT and JSTOR (the journal publisher) backed down, the prosecution kept on. I heard lots of theories: the feds who’d tried unsuccessfully to nail him for the PACER/RECAP stunt had a serious hate-on for him; the feds were chasing down all the Cambridge hackers who had any connection to Bradley Manning in the hopes of turning one of them, and other, less credible theories. A couple of lawyers close to the case told me that they thought Aaron would go to jail.\n\nAnd [Larry Lessig]({{% wayback \"http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully\" %}}):\n\n\u003e But all this shows is that if the government proved its case, some punishment was appropriate. So what was that appropriate punishment? Was Aaron a terrorist? Or a cracker trying to profit from stolen goods? Or was this something completely different? Early on, and to its great credit, JSTOR figured “appropriate” out: They declined to pursue their own action against Aaron, and they asked the government to drop its. MIT, to its great shame, was not as clear, and so the prosecutor had the excuse he needed to continue his war against the “criminal” who we who loved him knew as Aaron.\n\nAnd an [article from September]({{% wayback \"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120917/17393320412/us-government-ups-felony-count-jstoraaron-swartz-case-four-to-thirteen.shtml\" %}}) by Tim Cushing from TechDirt:\n\n\u003e Swartz, the executive director of Demand Progress, was charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a catch-all designation for “computer activity the US government doesn’t like.” Swartz had accessed MIT’s computer network to download a large number of files from JSTOR, a non-profit that hosts academic journal articles. US prosecutors claimed he “stole” several thousand files, but considering MIT offered this access for free on campus (and the files being digital), it’s pretty tough to square his massive downloading with any idea of “theft.”\n\n## Prosecutor as bully\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/aaron-swartz2.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Larry Lessig\" \u003e}} continues (reformatted paragraphs, mine):\n\n\u003e Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior.\n\u003e\n\u003e From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of *ACADEMIC ARTICLES* is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.\n\u003e\n\u003e Aaron had literally done nothing in his life “to make money.” He was fortunate Reddit turned out as it did, but from his work building the RSS standard, to his work architecting Creative Commons, to his work liberating public records, to his work building a free public library, to his work supporting Change Congress/FixCongressFirst/Rootstrikers, and then Demand Progress, Aaron was always and only working for (at least his conception of) the public good. He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?\n\u003e\n\u003e That person is gone today, driven to the edge by what a decent society would only call bullying. I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government \\[against\\] you. For remember, we live in a world where the architects of the financial crisis regularly dine at the White House — and where even those brought to “justice” never even have to admit any wrongdoing, let alone be labeled “felons.”\n\nAnd again from TechDirt:\n\n\u003e There are now 13 felony counts in the new indictment, derived from claims of multiple instances of breaking those four laws. In specific:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Wire Fraud - 2 counts\n\u003e * Computer Fraud - 5 counts\n\u003e * Unlawfully Obtaining Information from a Protected Computer - 5 counts\n\u003e * Recklessly Damaging a Protected Computer - 1 count\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s beyond my pay grade to figure out how many years in prison that all could be, when taking into account the complexities of sentencing law. Let’s leave it at a large scary number. Enough to ruin someone’s life.\n\nAnd the kicker…\n\n\u003e So, how do the new charges stack up in terms of a sentence? Tough to say. Each of the charges carries the possibility of a fine and imprisonment of up to 10–20 years per felony. Depending on how many of the counts Swartz is found guilty of, the sentence could conceivably total 50+ years and fine in the area of $4 million. All this over publicly accessed research documents that JSTOR doesn’t even feel the need to pursue further than it did.\n\n## In the end\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Alan Ellis\" \u003e}}, a nationally-recognized federal criminal defense lawyer [explains]({{% wayback \"http://www.alanellis.com\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Nearly 97 percent of all federal criminal defendants will plead guilty.

Instead, trumped-up charges by federal prosecutors resulted in him being sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary, followed by 5 years under probation, and another 15–20 years on the Sex Offender Registry living as a social pariah.\n\n(Studies by the U.S. Justice Department and other organizations show that [recidivism rates are significantly lower for convicted sex offenders than for burglars, robbers, thieves, drug offenders and other convicts]({{% wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/opinion/sunday/sex-offenders-the-last-pariahs.html?pagewanted=all\u0026_r=0\" %}}).)\n\nHe lost his home, his career, many of his friends, and because of his registry status he can’t find work — all because he made a stupid mistake. He’s doing everything he possibly can to re-assimilate back into society, but society doesn’t want him. His life was ruined. Fortunately, he’s smart, well-spoken and a hard worker.

This law would remove that hook.”\n\n## More links…\n\n* [A Chat with Aaron Swartz]({{% wayback \"http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-05-07-n78.html\" %}}) (Blogoscoped)\n* [Raw Thought: The Weblog of Aaron Swartz in Markdown, PDF, and ePub]({{% wayback \"https://github.com/joshleitzel/rawthought\" %}}) (GitHub)\n* [Carmen Ortiz Strikes Out]({{% wayback \"http://harpers.org/blog/2013/01/carmen-ortiz-strikes-out/\" %}}) (Harper’s)\n* [Still More About The Death Of Aaron Swartz]({{% wayback \"http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/aaron-swartz-case-011713\" %}}) (Esquire)\n* [How the Legal System Failed Aaron Swartz]({{% wayback \"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/01/everyone-interesting-is-a-felon.html?currentPage=all\" %}}) (The New Yorker)\n* [Darrell Issa Probing Prosecution Of Aaron Swartz, Internet Pioneer Who Killed Himself]({{% wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/15/darrell-issa-aaron-swartz-_n_2481450.html\" %}}) (Huffington Post)\n* [Lawmakers slam DOJ prosecution of Swartz as ‘ridiculous, absurd’]({{% wayback \"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/277353-lawmakers-blast-trumped-up-doj-prosecution-of-internet-activist\" %}}) (The Hill)\n* [Did Prosecutors Go Too Far In Swartz Case?]({{% wayback \"http://www.npr.org/2013/01/15/169421636/did-prosecutors-go-too-far-in-swartz-case\" %}}) (NPR)\n* [25,000 People Sign Petition to Remove Aaron Swartz’s Prosecutors]({{% wayback \"http://mashable.com/2013/01/15/aaron-swartz-petition/\" %}}) (Mashable)\n* [“Aaron’s law,” Congressional investigation in wake of Swartz suicide]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/01/aarons-law-congressional-investigation-in-wake-of-swartz-suicide/\" %}}) (Ars Technica)\n* [Farewell to Aaron Swartz, an extraordinary hacker and activist]({{% wayback \"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/farewell-aaron-swartz\" %}}) (Electronic Frontier Foundation)\n* [Feds go overboard in prosecuting information activist]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/feds-go-overboard-in-prosecuting-information-activist/\" %}}) (Ars Technica)\n* [Be free]({{% wayback \"https://public.resource.org/aaron/\" %}}) (resource.org)\n* [Aaron Swartz, Precocious Programmer and Internet Activist, Dies at 26]({{% wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html?pagewanted=all\" %}}) (New York Times)\n* [AaronSW may have left everything to Givewell, an efficient meta-charity]({{% wayback \"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5048123\" %}}) (Hacker News)\n* [Aaron Swartz’s legacy]({{% wayback \"http://www.vivtek.com/aaron_swartz_legacy.html\" %}}) (Michael Roberts)\n* [Aaron is dead.]({{% wayback \"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2013Jan/0017.html\" %}}) (Sir Tim Berners-Lee, W3C)\n* [Aaron Swartz]({{% wayback \"http://www.markbernstein.org/Jan13/AaronSwartz.html\" %}}) (Mark Bernstein)\n* [Aaron Swartz]({{% wayback \"http://inessential.com/2013/01/12/aaron_swartz\" %}}) (Brent Simmons)\n* [Soulmate lost.
