Ultimately, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t/wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hit our price, so we walked away. They continued to text message my girlfriend over the next couple of days using phrases like \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re living in a fantasy land\u0026rdquo; and other things that she and I both found incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"walking-back-into-the-_lions-den_\"\u003eWalking back into the \u003cem\u003elion’s den\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days later they got a different Jeep in stock.
