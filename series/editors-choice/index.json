The old SimplePie “OG” took a parse-at-all-costs philosophy, and could handle many of the most broken feeds you could find — at a cost. While the early versions of SimplePie supported the letter of the RSS 2.0 specification, there were a surprising number of feeds which didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce SimplePie started to get popular (2006–2008), we started getting bug reports from users who were working with RSS feeds containing elements such as \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;pubdate\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e (instead of \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;pubDate\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) and \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;managingeditor\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e (instead of \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;managingEditor\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e). At first we told users that the feeds were broken — which they were. But then we started getting enough reports that we decided to do something about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"introducing-xpath\"\u003eIntroducing XPath\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast-forward to the summer of 2017 when I started work on SimplePie NG in earnest. There are a number of things I’m doing differently (read: better) this time around. The first is that the \u003cem\u003efastest\u003c/em\u003e approach is the \u003cem\u003edefault\u003c/em\u003e approach. A corollary to this principle is that if you want to do more things, you will pay for them with performance penalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring my time working at Amazon Web Services on the SDK for PHP, I discovered some substantial performance gains by moving a lot of the response-parsing code to XPath. As such, the core XML parsing in SimplePie NG is all built around \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://secure.php.net/domdocument\"\u003eDOMDocument\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://secure.php.net/domxpath\"\u003eXPath\u003c/a\u003e queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo solve this case-insensitivity problem, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2893551/case-insensitive-matching-in-xpath\"\u003esearching Stack Overflow for “case insensitive xpath”\u003c/a\u003e tells you about the XPath 2.0 functions \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-matches\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ematches()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-lower-case\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003elower-case()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. However, I was surprised to learn that PHP only supports XPath 1.0. After doing some digging, the reason appears to be that the underlying \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/http://xmlsoft.org\"\u003elibxml2\u003c/a\u003e library only supports XPath 1.0, with \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2007-February/msg00077.html\"\u003eno updated support on the horizon\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only alternative that Google and Stack Overflow had for me was the XPath 1.0 function, \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/#function-translate\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. In PHP, the case-insensitive query for the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;rss\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e element would be:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-php\" data-lang=\"php\"\u003e/*[translate(name(), \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u0026#39;) = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39;]\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s simple enough to turn this into a pattern inside of a function. Case-insensitive XML parsing. Done. Boo-yah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"performance-testing\"\u003ePerformance-testing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little while later, I started some early work on benchmarking SimplePie NG. I parsed a number of normal-sized feeds, and got back a bunch of perfectly reasonable results. But one thing that I wanted to test was memory usage to make sure there were no memory leaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put together a quick and dirty test suite by starting with Tim Bray’s feed (one of the more nuanced and complex Atom 1.0 feeds), \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng/master/tests/Integration/feeds/full/atom10/tim-bray-500.xml\"\u003eduplicating the entries to a total of 500\u003c/a\u003e (increasing the size to around 3 MB), and then \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng/blob/master/tests/benchmarks/atom10.php\"\u003ewrote a test that flexed everything\u003c/a\u003e about SimplePie NG that I could think of. I then started running the test over and over again, collecting data about the timing and memory usage, and when the cache kicks-in and the engine warms up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"test-machine-and-environment\"\u003eTest machine and environment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m running this on a \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180204002621/https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\"\u003e2011 “Core i7” MacBook Pro\u003c/a\u003e, with 16 GB of RAM and an after-market SATA-III SSD.

I also have \u003cem\u003eXDebug\u003c/em\u003e enabled, and I’m testing on the CLI where \u003cem\u003eZend OpCache\u003c/em\u003e is disabled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"first-pass-case-insensitive-with-xpath-translate\"\u003eFirst pass; Case-insensitive with XPath translate()\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intial results for this 3 MB, 500-entry feed — with case-insensitivity enabled by way of the XPath \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e function — had an average runtime of \u003cstrong\u003e26 seconds\u003c/strong\u003e.

That’s \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo do some quick math, the normal query took only \u003cstrong\u003e14%\u003c/strong\u003e of the amount of time it took to do a case-insensitive query. Or, put another way, the case-insensitive query took around \u003cstrong\u003e7.5×\u003c/strong\u003e longer than the normal query. \u003cem\u003eThat’s awful!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"experimentation\"\u003eExperimentation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to find a way to improve the performance of the case-insensitive XPath query.

The goal was to transform the XML \u003cem\u003eonce\u003c/em\u003e with XSLT into a new XML document where all elements were lowercase, then I could just use regular XPath queries and avoid \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e all-together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, I still think this is a fantastic idea if \u003cem\u003eyou know where your XML data is coming from\u003c/em\u003e. Unfortunately for me, I don’t, and I was completely unable to craft an appropriate XSLT template that would allow me to convert all tag names to lowercase without breaking a bunch of other things (e.g., entities). I ended up having to abandon this path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"enabling-php-functions-in-xpath\"\u003eEnabling PHP functions in XPath\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only dabbled with this briefly, but there was no discernable performance improvement that I can recall. Also, the PHP documentation is lacking around this feature, so it was a lot of trial and error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"simplify-translate\"\u003eSimplify translate()\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I wondered if I could reduce the amount of time that \u003ccode\u003etranslate()\u003c/code\u003e takes if I simply gave it less work to do.

The old SimplePie “OG” took a parse-at-all-costs philosophy, and could handle many of the most broken feeds you could find — at a cost. While the early versions of SimplePie supported the letter of the RSS 2.0 specification, there were a surprising number of feeds which didn’t.\nOnce SimplePie started to get popular (2006–2008), we started getting bug reports from users who were working with RSS feeds containing elements such as \u0026lt;pubdate\u0026gt; (instead of \u0026lt;pubDate\u0026gt;) and \u0026lt;managingeditor\u0026gt; (instead of \u0026lt;managingEditor\u0026gt;). At first we told users that the feeds were broken — which they were. But then we started getting enough reports that we decided to do something about it.\nIntroducing XPath Fast-forward to the summer of 2017 when I started work on SimplePie NG in earnest. There are a number of things I’m doing differently (read: better) this time around. The first is that the fastest approach is the default approach. A corollary to this principle is that if you want to do more things, you will pay for them with performance penalties.\nDuring my time working at Amazon Web Services on the SDK for PHP, I discovered some substantial performance gains by moving a lot of the response-parsing code to XPath. As such, the core XML parsing in SimplePie NG is all built around DOMDocument and XPath queries.\nTo solve this case-insensitivity problem, searching Stack Overflow for “case insensitive xpath” tells you about the XPath 2.0 functions matches() and lower-case(). However, I was surprised to learn that PHP only supports XPath 1.0. After doing some digging, the reason appears to be that the underlying libxml2 library only supports XPath 1.0, with no updated support on the horizon.\nThe only alternative that Google and Stack Overflow had for me was the XPath 1.0 function, translate(). In PHP, the case-insensitive query for the \u0026lt;rss\u0026gt; element would be:\n/*[translate(name(), \u0026#39;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u0026#39;) = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39;] It’s simple enough to turn this into a pattern inside of a function. Case-insensitive XML parsing. Done. Boo-yah.\nPerformance-testing A little while later, I started some early work on benchmarking SimplePie NG. I parsed a number of normal-sized feeds, and got back a bunch of perfectly reasonable results. But one thing that I wanted to test was memory usage to make sure there were no memory leaks.\nI put together a quick and dirty test suite by starting with Tim Bray’s feed (one of the more nuanced and complex Atom 1.0 feeds), duplicating the entries to a total of 500 (increasing the size to around 3 MB), and then wrote a test that flexed everything about SimplePie NG that I could think of. I then started running the test over and over again, collecting data about the timing and memory usage, and when the cache kicks-in and the engine warms up.\nTest machine and environment I’m running this on a 2011 “Core i7” MacBook Pro, with 16 GB of RAM and an after-market SATA-III SSD. I have various background processes running, so it isn’t the same as running it on a fresh Linux web server. I also have XDebug enabled, and I’m testing on the CLI where Zend OpCache is disabled.\nFirst pass; Case-insensitive with XPath translate() The intial results for this 3 MB, 500-entry feed — with case-insensitivity enabled by way of the XPath translate() function — had an average runtime of 26 seconds. That was quite a bit slower than I was hoping for (especially on PHP 7.2), but then again it was a big file with a lot of entries.\nLet’s compare to case-insensitivity turned off (i.e., case-sensitive XML parsing).\nSecond pass; Normal, case-sensitive The next round of results on the same 3 MB, 500-entry feed—with standard case-sensitive XPath queries—had an average runtime of 3.5 seconds. That’s a lot better.\nTo do some quick math, the normal query took only 14% of the amount of time it took to do a case-insensitive query. Or, put another way, the case-insensitive query took around 7.5× longer than the normal query. That’s awful!\nExperimentation I had to find a way to improve the performance of the case-insensitive XPath query. Could I reduce the number of times I had to call translate()?\nXSLT I tried experimenting with XSLT for a few days. The goal was to transform the XML once with XSLT into a new XML document where all elements were lowercase, then I could just use regular XPath queries and avoid translate() all-together.\nOverall, I still think this is a fantastic idea if you know where your XML data is coming from. Unfortunately for me, I don’t, and I was completely unable to craft an appropriate XSLT template that would allow me to convert all tag names to lowercase without breaking a bunch of other things (e.g., entities). I ended up having to abandon this path.\nEnabling PHP functions in XPath I only dabbled with this briefly, but there was no discernable performance improvement that I can recall. Also, the PHP documentation is lacking around this feature, so it was a lot of trial and error.\nSimplify translate() Finally, I wondered if I could reduce the amount of time that translate() takes if I simply gave it less work to do. Instead of giving it the entire alphabet, what if I only gave it the letters that were in the XML element name?\nPHP has a function count_chars() that can return the unique characters in a string. From here, we can create upper and lower-case versions of the string, and just use those in the translate() function.\n\u0026lt;?php $word = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39;; $elementLetters = \\count_chars($word, 3); $lettersLower = \\mb_strtolower($elementLetters); $lettersUpper = \\mb_strtoupper($elementLetters); $query = \\sprintf( \u0026#39;/*[translate(name(), \\\u0026#39;%s\\\u0026#39;, \\\u0026#39;%s\\\u0026#39;) = \\\u0026#39;%s\\\u0026#39;]\u0026#39;, $lettersUpper, $lettersLower, $word ); # /*[translate(name(), \u0026#39;RS\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rs\u0026#39;) = \u0026#39;rss\u0026#39; $results = $domxpath-\u0026gt;query($query); Testing this approach on the same 3 MB, 500-entry feed — with case-insensitivity enabled by way of our smarter translate() function — had an average runtime of 17 seconds.\nRunning the same benchmarks against my other test feeds consistently showed a 30–35% improvement in performance when using only the required letters in the translate() function instead of the entire alphabet.\nWrapping-up Even with this technique (on this particular set of data, with this particular testing approach), case-insensitive queries are still 4.5–5× slower than their case-sensitive counterparts. Using the translate() XPath 1.0 function in PHP has a substantial impact on performance, so don’t use it if you don’t have to.\nI still think that there is some viability in leveraging XSLT in a first pass, which I expect would substantially reduce the case-insensitive processing time, but someone with more XSLT experience than me would need to contribute that code.\nLastly, SimplePie NG performs the faster case-sensitive queries by default. You are able to opt-in to case-insensitive mode on a per-feed basis. If you’re just processing a few average-sized feeds with this mode enabled, you probably won’t notice much of an impact.\n",

You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"f5IcBtaMR_k\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube.

You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also had those motion controls.

Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years.

For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed.

You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\n\nYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/super-mario-galaxy.jpg\" alt=\"Super Mario Galaxy\"\u003e}}\n\nYou also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\n\nSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\n\nLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\n\n* Super Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2)\n* Mario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.)\n* Metroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.)\n* Super Smash Bros. Brawl\n* Super Paper Mario\n* New Super Mario Bros.\n* …and Donkey Kong Returns was pretty good.\n\n8 good games on that console and everything else was crap. Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\n\n## Wii U\n\nWii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\n\n{{\u003c yt \"4e3qaPg_keg\" \u003e}}\n\nAlso, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\n\nInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\n\nThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\n\n## What’s next with the NX?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/nx.jpg\" alt=\"Nintendo NX\"\u003e}}\n\n### Nintendo Account\n\nStill, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\n\nFirst, figure out how to run a _freaking_ Nintendo account.\n\n1. I should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\n\n1. I should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\n\n1. Some of us live international lives. Allow me to log onto my child’s Canadian console using my U.S. account, so that I can continue using my game data (etc.) while spending time with my children in another country.\n\n1. There should not be separate balances for the Wii U store vs. the 3DS store. This is ridiculous. They should be the same store, the same account, the same money. I login, buy stuff, and play.\n\n1. Lastly, I should be able to throw my console in the ocean, buy a new one, log-in, and be able to re-download all of my games and settings.\n\nMicrosoft has this figured out. Apple has this figured out. Sony has this _(sorta)_ figured out. Why haven’t you been able to figure this out yet?\n\n### Normal Controllers\n\n_Please, for the love of god, stop making controllers “unique”_. I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/retro-fighters.jpg\" alt=\"Retro Fighters N64 controller\"\u003e}}\n\nGive us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware. Save that for games and gameplay, not hardware.\n\n### Figure out the first vs. third-party game situation\n\nNintendo hardware has been running a generation behind ever since the Wii was released in 2006. It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\n\nI’m sure that [Super Mario 3D World]({{\u003c wayback \"http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\" \u003e}}) doesn’t require as much processing power as [Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.callofduty.com/advancedwarfare\" \u003e}}), so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\n\nYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\n\nNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant. You make the best games for your own console. But — there are a few things to think about, because you’ve been sending mixed signals for a long time now.\n\n1. If you want to focus on making first-party games on Nintendo consoles, that’s great. But you need to _actually focus on making first-party games_. You didn’t do this for the first half of the Wii U’s existence.\n\n1. If you don’t want to put much effort into third-party games, that’s cool too — but say so. Stop allowing so much crapware to be sold for Nintendo consoles. But also remember that if the best third-party games are on a Sony or Microsoft console, and customers have a limited budget, who’s console are they going to buy?\n\n1. If you want to enable and support third-party developers, great! Then do it! Provide them support, help them to deliver the best possible gaming experiences, and ship hardware that is as powerful as the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.\n\n### Embrace Digital Downloads\n\nDigital downloads are _the now_, not just _the future_. Build out a world-class online store that can be accessed from TV consoles, handheld consoles, and computer Internet users alike. Focus on making downloads both fast and plentiful. Ship fewer and fewer games on disc, and instead ship larger hard drives that support expansion through external disks.\n\nEmbrace broadband, hard drives, digital downloads, and a world-class online store. You implemented the kids’ version of those things in the Wii U. Now build a modern version for grown-ups.\n\n### Pay Attention to your Competition\n\nAside from Nintendo, Apple is the only other company with small-screen (e.g., iOS) and large screen (e.g., macOS, tvOS) gaming platforms. Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK). They have way more users than Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony combined. They have powerful developer frameworks that enable game developers to build bigger, better, faster worlds.\n\nThe new Apple TV is squarely in your turf. No, they may not have their own Marios or Zeldas or Samuses, but their platform has enabled the likes of [Lili]({{\u003c wayback \"http://bitmonstergames.com/games/lili-child-of-geos/\" \u003e}}), [Oceanhorn]({{\u003c wayback \"https://oceanhorn.blogspot.com/\" \u003e}}), and [The Legend of Skyfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brKnX2zlTzE). They may not (yet) have the rich history of Nintendo’s characters, but it’s only a matter of time.\n\n{{\u003c yt brKnX2zlTzE \u003e}}\n\nRight now, Apple is focused on TV. And that’s probably good for you. But what happens when they ship an Apple TV “Pro” focused on gaming? They have an excellent SDK, an excellent games platform, the MFi Controller program, rock-solid account management, extremely fast game (i.e., “app”) downloads, and a dearth of end-users with limited funds for new game consoles?\n\n{{% aside %}}\nSee the follow-up, “[Dear Nintendo, Part II](/posts/2018/dear-nintendo-part-ii/)”\n{{% /aside %}}\n"},

Earlier today, someone I know posted this image on Facebook.\n “TRUTH!!!”, my friend exclaimed.\n As a rational person who values evidence and critical thinking, this photo misses the point by grossly oversimplifying a very complex issue. And while it maybe be technically true, that’s only in the most ideal sociological conditions.\nThe real world is far more complex.\n(Instead of being flippant and dismissive toward people you disagree with, challenge the things that you think you know. See if those ideas hold-up to scrutiny when the hard questions are asked. I did, and I realized that there were some really good, valid points being made by both sides of the gun ownership issue. Take the time to listen to what other people think, and why they think it, and you might see a perspective you hadn’t seen before.)\nIt’s far too easy… It\u0026rsquo;s not about the gun, per sé, but it is definitely about the ability to commit mass-murder with a gun. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen or heard of anybody committing mass-murder with a rock.\nWe have invented procedures and invested in research and development to make cars safer, airplanes safer, construction equipment safer, kitchen appliances safer, etc. Why isn\u0026rsquo;t the weapons industry investing into better procedures and security for weapons?\nNeither a \u0026ldquo;heart\u0026rdquo; nor a rock are able to kill 50 people in a nightclub within minutes. A rock could be used to kill a 22 year old singer who is signing autographs after a concert. However, if by investing more effort into background checks and psychological evaluations, or by inventing biometrics safety techniques or other methods which prevent accidental gun deaths, how many lives could be saved?\nTwo sides of the same coin. I strongly support responsible gun ownership AND strong gun control laws. Those are not opposing ideas, but rather complementary ones. I personally believe there is value in more people being armed — primarily people performing security roles at schools, malls and airports. Looking at someone and expecting that they are packing heat will keep your actions in check.\nBut I also believe that asking people to undergo a psychological evaluation is not an unreasonable request. Neither is closing the gun show loophole, or asking people to certify before they can legally own a gun (and re-certify every few years, like a driver\u0026rsquo;s license), or requiring a class which educates you on responsible, legal gun ownership versus hand-me-down stories of what can do (or get away with) with a gun.\n(For example, it is a federal crime to shoot down an operational aircraft — including a drone — that is flying in the airspace above your property. You may own the land, but you do not own the air above it.)\nIt is a 100% perfect system? Absolutely not. A determined person will always find a way to do whatever they’re going to do. But just because the idea or implementation is not 100% perfect doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother doing anything at all.\nGuns don\u0026rsquo;t kill people, but we can do better.  The United States has 3–4× the number of gun-related murders per capita than any other modern, civilized nation. This does not include accidental gun-related deaths.\n Guns don\u0026rsquo;t kill people. People kill people. But that doesn’t absolve our society of responsibility for the actions that we allow our people to take.\nYes, it is true that people kill people. But a gun in the hands of a dangerous person is capable of taking a substantially higher number of lives at once than nearly any other weapon humankind has ever devised1. We do not show enough respect for this dangerous capability as we should as a society.\nWhat if we could reduce gun-related deaths by 20%… 30%… 40%? Would that be worth it? Are the lives of those people are worth it? Are the lives of the kids at Sandy Hook Elementary worth it? Are the lives of the reporter and cameraman who were gunned-down on-air worth it? Are the lives of the kids who get a hold of their parents’ gun and accidentally kill themselves, their parent, or their siblings worth it?\nGuns are far too easy to purchase through legal channels because of well-known loopholes in the system. By closing the legal loopholes, law enforcement can spend more time focusing on covering illegal gun sales.\nJustifying an outrageous failure France, Germany, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Australia, Spain, and even the Czech Republic are ahead of us on this issue. For a country which claims to be the best country in the entire world, how can we continue to justify such an outrageous failure of our society?\nGun control does not mean taking away your guns. It doesn’t mean a disarmament of you and your family (unless your family is crazy, of course). It refers to the enforcement of the responsibility of owning a gun. You’re responsible, right?\nThe founding fathers granted us the right to form and maintain a militia… using muskets. They did not know that one day the weapons industry would rake-in billions of dollars per year. They did not know that our society would shift from being primarily rural to being primarily urban/industrial. It does not mean that you are guaranteed the right to own assault weapons.\nHow much longer? How long are we going to stand by and do nothing (except pray) while angry/crazy people shoot-up large groups of people? How long are we going to update our Facebook profile photos with the French flag, or hear about yet another mass-shooting (San Bernadino, Orlando, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, etc.), and choose to do absolutely nothing at all about lifting a finger to make things better?\nBecause guns.

The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-a-better-america\"\u003eMaking A Better America\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ePhoto by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen \u003cem\u003edramatically\u003c/em\u003e since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works.

But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don\u0026rsquo;t like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they\u0026rsquo;re not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing.

Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for me.\n And lastly,\n Americans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government. In fact, as a proud Finn, I often like to remind my American friends that my countrymen in Finland fought two brutal wars against the Soviet Union to preserve Finland\u0026rsquo;s freedom and independence against socialism. No one wants to live in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support individual liberty, entrepreneurship, and open markets.\nBut the truth is that free-market capitalism and universal social policies go well together — this isn\u0026rsquo;t about big government, it\u0026rsquo;s about smart government.\n This is a very good piece, and I hope you can take a few minutes to read it all. In the U.S., and especially among the Boomer generation, they hear \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and tend to equate it with Russian communism (which was actually never communism, but rather a dictator-style totalitarian socialism).\nToo Much Capitalism Is Bad For You  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/5065175199/in/album-72157652056682098/\n For me, I see the pros and cons of such a capitalistic-driven society. The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\nSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\nMaking A Better America  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\n I want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen dramatically since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\nWhat I’m currently hearing from Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , and Rand Paul is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again and including all Americans in that plan.\nUnfair?  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/22122675480/in/album-72157652056682098/\n Yes, a 60 year old couple with no kids paying more money in taxes so that some other couple can have their kids in better daycare sounds unfair at first. But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don\u0026rsquo;t like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they\u0026rsquo;re not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\nMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing. By raising-up the foundation for everyone, everybody benefits, albeit indirectly.\nSupport the Radical Center  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157652056682098/\n Lastly, I think our current 2-party system is the most toxic aspect of American politics. What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you must vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate. The Republican party has already assumed that Clinton will win the nomination on the Democratic side, but the race between herself and Sanders is extremely close. Conversely, the fact that loose cannons like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have made it as far as they have over more sane and level-headed candidates like Rand Paul and Marco Rubio is saddening.\nThe only way to break free of the 2-party system is to stop reinforcing this 2-party mentality. IMO, it’s toxic to the American people that the RNC and the DNC are private corporations who pay for broadcast airtime, and can change the rules to determine who can/cannot be part of the debates. This leads to Tweedism, and further separates the voters from the nomination process (in addition to super-delegates and the electoral college).\n Source: Lessig at MIT: \u0026#34;Tweedism\u0026#34;\nI would also love to see the entire population of the United States abstain from the next election until we could vote on meaningful campaign finance reform, but that will never happen.\nReform Ultimately, however, none of the promises made by presidential candidates will come to pass without substantial campaign finance reform. Congress decides on the budget, and it is the President’s job to spend that budget. With so many congresspeople in the pockets of large corporations instead of working in the best interests of the citizens they represent, there is little that will be accomplished until we achieve meaningful reform. With Ted Cruz taking money from the Oil \u0026amp; Coal industries, with Hillary Clinton taking money from Wall Street, and with Donald Trump taking money from the KKK, we’re all in big trouble.\nCitizen-funded elections is the only way to achieve this.\nP.S.

That's probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\n\u003e\n\u003e A Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I'm now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I'm told, because they are small, homogeneous \"nanny states\" where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\n\u003e\n\u003e This, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don't feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I'm told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\n\nAnd follows that up with an important premise:\n\n\u003e But this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy.

Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals.

Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth.

Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t change anybody but yourself\u0026rdquo; is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal?

We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026amp; 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u0026lt;5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the  education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144532/http://stemcells.nih.gov/research/scilit/highlights/pages/default.aspx\"\u003ehearing and sight recovery\u003c/a\u003e, as well as ALS (a.k.a., \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150927144532/http://www.webmd.com/brain/features/als-stem-cell-patient-trial\"\u003eLou Gehrig’s Disease\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanging jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote \u003cem\u003eagainst\u003c/em\u003e, instead of telling why they themselves are worth \u003cem\u003evoting for\u003c/em\u003e. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics.

And although they never actually said it, I was definitely taught that \u003cem\u003eJesus votes Republican\u003c/em\u003e. It wasn’t until my mid-20’s that I started seriously reviewing the issues, asking hard questions about them, and seeing where things still stood up vs. where they fell down. In the end, I realized that most things I’d been taught, politically, didn’t stand-up to scrutiny very well. I also wasn’t a strong supporter of most of what the Democratic party stood for either, so I find myself as an Independent — neither major party represents me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the direction that the Republican party has taken over the last 20 years, I find that they represent me less and less with each passing year. My own observations have shown me: More discrimination. More lying and misdirection instead of facts. More hatred towards people who aren’t WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants). More fear, uncertainty and doubt. More pro-theocratic thinking. Anti-women efforts. Pro-business/anti-citizen efforts. Support of the Constitution, but against the Government, because they don’t know how the Constitution works. Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns pv4-l\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.webp\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" class=\"db fullimage-noshadow\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:600px; max-width:600px;\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/self-serving-rhetoric.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\" class=\"db fullimage-noshadow\" decoding=\"async\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:600px; max-width:600px;\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"rankings-and-standings\"\u003eRankings and Standings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric.

        "plain":"As a political moderate who values sanity and evidence over emotional rage in politics, I really tried to keep an open mind about the various candidates from across the political spectrum. I wanted to listen to what they had to say, watch how respectfully they treated the other candidates — across party lines — and dissect and challenge their empty rhetoric.\nThis was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n  https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157624426458536/\n Things I believe in   We live in a digital world, that will continue to become more digital as time passes. We need to support the continued freedom of the Internet against businesses/oligarchies/cartels who would try to de-level the playing field for monetary gains (see Net Neutrality).\n  God made us stewards of this earth, and we need to take that responsibility seriously — whether or not we believe that the earth will still be around at some point in the future. Also, yes, global warming and climate change are a real thing. God invented science, and science says that, yes, climate change is occurring.\n  As an American citizen, there are certain things that I believe should be considered rights because they are fundamental to the American way of life as a whole (whether you personally choose to use them or not). Running water, electricity, functional roads, Internet access, a police force, a fire department, access to doctors and health professionals. These should be parts of the safety net that holds America together at a fundamental level.\n  I strongly support \u0026ldquo;freedom\u0026rdquo; in America, by which I mean that I support laws and legislation that are the best interests of individual citizens. Laws that help and lift the American people, and NOT those which discriminate, NOT those those which are pro-monopoly/oligarchy, and NOT those that favor the rich more than the poor, and NOT those which support theocracy in America.\n  I believe that education is the singularly-most-important thing that Americans can do for ourselves. By ensuring that even the poorest of us has a good education, we raise the level for everyone in the nation. Comparatively to other nations, our scores have been dropping across the board. We cannot continue to do things the way that we’ve been doing them. I believe that Common Core is a good thing because it helps to push the next generation forward, even if it means that parents (who weren’t that good at math and english anyway) get left behind. Educate every child, regardless of their immigration, income or social status. Make college more affordable. Demand higher standards for graduating — with a strong focus on math, english, the Internet, and critical thinking.\n  My daughter will grow-up to be the greatest woman in the history of earth. Why is she only worth 77% of a man in the workplace? I’ve seen/heard how women are treated in the dating scene and it’s disgusting. I am ashamed of my gender. I want my daughter to understand that she’s worth so much more than how some idiot on the street will probably treat her. I want my son AND my daughter to know themselves, their emotions, their bodies, and how they work so that they can make better decisions for themselves in relationships.\n  Why is it OK for Fox to air movies by Michael Bay with violence and explosions and nobody bats an eye, or the Real Housewives of Wherever with constant cat-fighting and passive-aggressive jealousy, but everybody loses their collective minds when Miley Cyrus accidentally shows one nipple on the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? I mean, I understand that the American colonies were started by The Puritans, but it’s just a nipple.\n  The war on drugs was a failure, so let\u0026rsquo;s move on. Of the many lectures that my dad gave me growing-up, \u0026ldquo;you can\u0026rsquo;t change anybody but yourself\u0026rdquo; is the one that has stuck with me over the years. That includes drug users. Why is marijuana illegal but alcohol legal? Why is medical/therapeutic uses of MDMA by licensed professionals a felony when it has been used to help people all over the world?\n  We over-incarcerate, then make it nearly impossible for people to re-build their lives post-incarceration. We should de-criminalize drug offenses, and many non-violent offenses, and instead push harder for more, legitimate, rehabilitation. “Mandatory minimums” are based on flawed logic that is not supported by factual evidence and are simply the result of fear-mongering.\n  Sex-offense laws are fundamentally broken. A 17 \u0026amp; 18 year old boyfriend and girlfriend sleep together. The oldest of the two is convicted of “rape” and ends up on the sex-offender registry — in some places (like California), for life. The number of people on the sex-offender registry who re-offend are in the low, single-digit percents (\u0026lt;5%). What about the other 95% of people who made mistakes, are convicted of non-violent sexual indiscretions, but become social pariahs? Those who can’t get jobs to feed themselves and their families? Who can get additional time added-on to their punishments on a whim, but have it be considered an “administrative change” as opposed to being based on something objective like their sentencing by a judge.\n  I am pro-contraception, pro-sex education, pro-sex for enjoyment, pro-sexual responsibility, and pro-life. I believe that if you want to prevent abortions, you need to provide support for contraception, sexual health, sexual education, and adoption. You cannot support “abstinence-only ‘education’” and also be pro-life, and expect any kind of positive results. We need to give the people the education and tools that they need to make positive decisions. There are civil rights, and there are natural rights, and when in conflict, natural rights will always trump civil rights. This includes the right to be born in the first place. I believe that life begins when a fertilized egg implants itself into the uterine lining and, if left alone, would result in the birth of a child. Yes, there are horrible things and horrible people in this world, and bad things happen to good people. I sympathize very much with victims of violent sexual acts (including rape), and the unfairness/horribleness of the matter not something that can be easily dismissed. But, when all issues from all sides are considered, I still find myself squarely on the side of life.\n  I support the advancement of stem-cell research. If a child’s life has been lost to abortion, then instead of simply throwing-out the bodies (or pieces of the body, in some cases), allow that child’s death to be used for something positive. Studying stem-cells has already shown positive results in helping with cell-regeneration impacting hearing and sight recovery, as well as ALS (a.k.a., Lou Gehrig’s Disease).\n  Changing jobs from a congressperson to a lobbyist is a massive conflict of interest. The average congressperson spends 30-70% of their time fundraising for their next term. When they leave congress for a lobbyist job in the private sector, their salary usually jumps by 10x. How is this in the best interests of of the American people?\n  I absolutely hate it when politicians turn-on the mud-slinging, telling me who to vote against, instead of telling why they themselves are worth voting for. This is a gigantic negative for me, because an effective leader is NOT one who pulls to one side and stands their ground no matter what, but rather one who listens, collaborates, and finds ways to bring people together so that we can move forward as a single nation. This is one area where I’ve seen President Obama try very hard to bring both sides together, but wasn’t able to pull it off because most of our congresspeople choose to behave like babies.\n  I believe that only having 2 major political parties is one of the worst aspects of American politics. Anything we can do to break-apart the two-party system would be a fantastic improvement over what we have today.\n  The Tea Party is the American Taliban.\n   https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157624426458536/\n My background I was raised in a very conservative, Christian, Republican household. I was taught that you had to vote Republican because otherwise the evil Democrats will win. And although they never actually said it, I was definitely taught that Jesus votes Republican. It wasn’t until my mid-20’s that I started seriously reviewing the issues, asking hard questions about them, and seeing where things still stood up vs. where they fell down. In the end, I realized that most things I’d been taught, politically, didn’t stand-up to scrutiny very well. I also wasn’t a strong supporter of most of what the Democratic party stood for either, so I find myself as an Independent — neither major party represents me.\nWith the direction that the Republican party has taken over the last 20 years, I find that they represent me less and less with each passing year. My own observations have shown me: More discrimination. More lying and misdirection instead of facts. More hatred towards people who aren’t WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestants). More fear, uncertainty and doubt. More pro-theocratic thinking. Anti-women efforts. Pro-business/anti-citizen efforts. Support of the Constitution, but against the Government, because they don’t know how the Constitution works. Things are all things that a well-educated, thoughtful individual (as I see myself being) cannot get in-line with.\n https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/9718341239/in/album-72157624426458536/\n Rankings and Standings For me, this is how the various candidates break down after the past several months of reading, watching, asking questions, and challenging their rhetoric. There are zero people whom I agree with 100%. Some issues matter more to me than others, and based on the ones that matter, this is where I stand with the current candidates.\n  Definitely Yes: Larry Lessig, Bernie Sanders — Both are pro-citizen, are willing to listen to others, campaign finance reform, do NOT take an us-against-them stance, and support positive change for this country. They have not accepted any money from Super PACs, except for Larry Lessig who founded the MayDay Super PAC — “the Super PAC to end all Super PACs.” I disagree with Bernie Sanders’ stance on abortion, but fully support his stance on reproductive health, contraception, and sexual education.\n  Wouldn’t be Angry: Hillary Clinton — She’s pro-women and pro-minorities, which could help to lay the groundwork for when my daughter comes of age. I have not seen her do any mud-slinging thus far, except to suggest that she disagrees with much of what was discussed during the Republican debates. At the same time, she’s done some really shady things around sending top-secret emails though her personal email server (!!), and she supports treating Edward Snowden like a domestic terrorist. She’s also raised most of her money from Super PACs.\n  Would be irritated: Rand Paul — He’s been really hit-or-miss so far. He started his campaign by slinging mud and rhetoric against Hillary Clinton instead of telling us why we should vote for him. He supports simplifying the tax code (yay!) but is against Net Neutrality (boo!). He is also a candidate that has enjoyed using the rhetorical call-to-action “we need to take America back” without ever explaining what on earth that even means. Back to the Salem Witch Trials? Back to slavery and segregation? Back to when women couldn’t vote? Back to the recession, multiple wars, and the Credit Crisis from last decade?\n  OMGWTFBBQ: Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Carly Fiorina — Ted Cruz wants to kill the Ayatollah and thinks that Net Neutrality is ObamaCare for the Internet. Mike Huckabee believes that it’s perfectly OK for a government employee to violate the Constitution because it’s against Kim Davis’ faith to support gay marriage. Of course, so is sex outside of marriage and divorcing for reasons other than infidelity or abandonment¹²³⁴, but who’s counting? The others, I simply disagree with on the majority of issues — at least in cases where they are clear where they stand.\n  The worst possible thing for America: Donald Trump — Misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, sexist, selfish, pro-business at the cost of individual citizens, enthusiastically leverages tax/legal loopholes for personal gain, and is a supporter of continued “cronyism” in government. Although, I agree with him that we should stop buying oil from foreign nations, and should instead rely on ourselves.\n  I am most-aligned with Elizabeth Warren, although she isn’t running — this time around, anyway.\n https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\n ",

Back to the recession, multiple wars, and the [Credit Crisis]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0zEXdDO5JU\" \u003e}}) from last decade?\n\n1. **OMGWTFBBQ:** [Ted Cruz]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Ted_Cruz.htm\" \u003e}}), [Jeb Bush]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Jeb_Bush.htm\" \u003e}}), [Mike Huckabee]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Mike_Huckabee.htm\" \u003e}}), [Carly Fiorina]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Carly_Fiorina.htm\" \u003e}}) — [Ted Cruz wants to kill the Ayatollah]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/09/25/ted-cruz-threatens-to-kill-the-ayatollah.html\" \u003e}}) and thinks that [Net Neutrality is ObamaCare for the Internet]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/ted-cruz-net-neutrality_n_6133584.html\" \u003e}}). Mike Huckabee believes that [it’s perfectly OK for a government employee to violate the Constitution]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-jail-huckabee_55ef258be4b093be51bc5dcc\" \u003e}}) because it’s against [Kim Davis’ faith to support gay marriage]({{\u003c wayback \"http://m.snopes.com/kim-davis-married-four-times/\" \u003e}}). Of course, so is sex outside of marriage and divorcing for reasons other than infidelity or abandonment[¹]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/deu.24.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[²]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/mat.5.31-33.kjv\" \u003e}})[³]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/rom.7.1-4.kjv\" \u003e}})[⁴]({{\u003c wayback \"https://www.bible.com/bible/1/1co.7\" \u003e}}), but who’s counting? The others, I simply disagree with on the majority of issues — at least in cases where they are clear where they stand.\n\n1. **The worst possible thing for America:** [Donald Trump]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm\" \u003e}}) — Misogynistic, xenophobic, racist, sexist, selfish, pro-business at the cost of individual citizens, enthusiastically leverages tax/legal loopholes for personal gain, and is a supporter of continued “cronyism” in government. Although, I agree with him that we should stop buying oil from foreign nations, and should instead rely on ourselves.\n\nI am most-aligned with [Elizabeth Warren]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Elizabeth_Warren.htm\" \u003e}}), although she isn’t running — this time around, anyway.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2015/vote-moderate.jpg\" alt=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" figure=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764159806/in/album-72157624426458536/\" width=\"600\"\u003e}}\n"},

        "plain":"I take password security very seriously. I’ve already written about how people can improve their password habits to keep themselves safe. This piece, however, is for those of you who build websites which provide password-related functionality.   This is a list of password crimes that some websites commit. I’ve described these crimes, then point out some criminals (a.k.a., websites) which commit these crimes.\n(This list is not guaranteed to continue to be up-to-date. This post represents a snapshot in time, and is accurate as of early June 2014 when the first draft of this post was written.)\nBasic usability   I should always be able to change my password from within my user preferences. If I have to log out and pretend like I’ve forgotten my password in order to change it, your system is broken. (Authy, TunnelBear)\n  If anything with your site or service requires a password, always allow me to change it from the web — even if changing my password is the only thing I can do. (Automatic, Zite, Steam)\n  Make it super-easy to find where to change my password. Do not bury the link to make it more difficult. (LinkedIn)\n  If my password change was successful, please tell me very clearly. If not, please tell me very clearly. (Last.fm, Disqus, Bible.com)\n  Provide clarity at all times   If you require my current password in order to change my password, then ask for it up-front. Don’t hide it, then surprise me. Don’t ask for it after I’ve put in my new password. Be direct and forthcoming about it. (Kickstarter, CloudApp, Spotify)\n  Be explicitly clear about what the password requirements are. Not just the low-end — make sure you document the high-end requirements too. I often run into cases where my passwords are too secure for the system. (Morgan Stanley, Life 360, H\u0026amp;R Block, Zendesk, Beatport, Secure Checkout by Visa)\n  If you wait until after I try to change my password to tell me how long it’s allowed to be, you’re a huge jerk. (H\u0026amp;R Block, MyFitnessPal, SourceForge, Secure Checkout by Visa)\n  If my password is too long, don’t complain that it’s too short and not tell me the maximum allowable length. (Beats Music)\n  If you list your password requirements on your website for people to use, make sure that the ones you list are actually correct. (Morgan Stanley, Secure Checkout by Visa)\n  Avoid confusion     If I’ve managed to inadvertently create two accounts, make it easy for me to merge them. If you suck, and require me to delete one of them, then actually delete the account. (Adobe, Readability, Facebook)\n  Never allow two accounts to have the same email address, then allow users to login with their email address. There is a 100% chance that this will ruin someone’s day. (Readability, Amazon Web Services)\n  Provide a useful “forgot password” page   On the “forgot password” page, always allow me to enter my email address. I may not always know some random username, but I will always know my email address. If I try to look-up my password and you ask for a username (i.e., lookup by email address is not supported), then make me go to another lookup for my username, your system is broken. Support both if possible, otherwise err on the side of email address. (Pottermore)\n  If your password change/reset form(s) accepts my new password, then the login page should too. If my password doesn’t pass validation for logging in, then it shouldn’t pass when I change it via account preferences or the “forgot password” page. (Morgan Stanley)\n  Be liberal in what you accept   Never tell me that an email address with the “+” character is invalid. Yes it is. You’re dumb, you’re ugly, and your mother never loved you.\n  You shouldn’t be storing my real password, ever. You should only be storing a cryptographic hash of my password for comparison. (Never use MD5 and never use SHA–1. You should be using SHA–256 at minimum, which is 64 hexadecimal digits long.) Because of this, the following principles should always be true.\n  Accept any password I give you, and be happy about it. Even if it’s 128 consecutive NULL bytes, or a long string of multi-byte characters, accept it gladly. Chances are, I’m smarter than your system, so allow me to be. (Anyone who limits supported characters.)\n  If you accept only certain “special characters” (a.k.a., “characters” — none are “special”), be explicitly clear which ones they are. If I try to use “£” in my password, but it isn’t allowed, tell me: “Your password contains the ‘£’ character, which is not allowed.” (Usability bonus)\n  If you have a length limit on passwords, the string limit should be no smaller than 64 bytes. Yes, 64 bytes. The next bank (or other service) to tell me that my password may only be 5–12 alphanumeric characters is going to immediately lose my business. (Life 360)\n    Support OAuth consistently, or not at all     If you allow me to sign-up/log-in to the desktop version of the website with Facebook (or any other OAuth provider), then you must always have that login option available everywhere else (e.g., mobile web, native mobile app, being an OAuth provider, asking for my password to change my password). I don’t have a password otherwise.\n  If I create an account with Facebook, then go to the mobile app and can’t login without a first-party password, I’m screwed. (TripIt)\n  If I then try to add (change) my password, but I have to know my current (imaginary) password before “changing” it to add one, I’m also screwed. (Engadget, Beatport)\n    Real security, not “Security Theater”   Instead of asking me random/stupid “security questions”, give me the option of using two-factor authentication. It’s more secure and easier to use. (Pretty much every bank and financial institution on the planet.)\n  If your second factor is SMS, fine. Not great, but fine. (Twitter, Etsy)\n  Even better is to support Authy, Google Authenticator, or an RSA key fob token as the second-factor authentication mechanism.\n    Don’t break the web   Never prevent me from copy-pasting my password. I use a password manager so that I don’t have to remember it, you pretentious prick. (Paypal)\n  Understand that an increasing number of people are using password managers. This is a very good thing. This also means (a) the username and password fields should always maintain the same HTML field name, (b) if you change the URL, the old URL should redirect to the new one — especially if you’ve changed the login domain.

The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” […]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeb addresses are rich and revealing content.

        "plain":"I’ve been paying quite a bit of attention to the story of Edward Snowden — the former CIA contractor who leaked classified information to the American public about how the government is spying on us through acronym-laden programs known as “PRISM” and “MUSCULAR”.   Allow me to be your tour guide as we uncover just a few of the ways in which the NSA has broken the law and spied on American citizens.\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978) It all started in 1978 with the passage of FISA:\n The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (“FISA” Pub.L. 95–511, 92 Stat. 1783, 50 U.S.C. ch. 36) is a United States federal law which prescribes procedures for the physical and electronic surveillance and collection of “foreign intelligence information” between “foreign powers” and “agents of foreign powers” (which may include American citizens and permanent residents suspected of espionage or terrorism). The law does not apply outside the United States. It has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks.\n FISA was amended in 2001 by The Patriot Act:\n The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 26, 2001. […]\nOn May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the “library records provision”), and conducting surveillance of “lone wolves”—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.\n Then again by the Protect America Act of 2007:\n The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), (Pub.L. 110–55, 121 Stat. 552, enacted by S. 1927), is a controversial amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on August 5, 2007. It removed the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets “reasonably believed” to be outside of the United States. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.\n And yet again by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008:\n Warrantless wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) was revealed publicly in late 2005 by the New York Times and then discontinued in January 2007. […] Approximately forty lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies by groups and individuals alleging that the Bush administration illegally monitored their phone calls or e-mails. Whistleblower evidence suggests that AT\u0026amp;T was complicit in the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, which could have involved the private communications of millions of Americans.\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to * 10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. In addition, the Wiretap Act prohibits any person from illegally intercepting, disclosing, using, or divulging phone calls or electronic communications; this is punishable with a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.\n (All 3 sets of amendments to FISA were passed by Congresses operating during the George W. Bush administration.)\nEdward Snowden , Whistleblower   In May 2013, Edward Snowden ’s leak of Top Secret-level NSA material was called “the most significant leak in U.S. history” by Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers (1971).\nThe U.S. government has charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government secrets. President Obama’s response was reported by Z. Byron Wolf, writing for CNN:\n Even as he announced changes to the NSA programs, including the appointment of an independent government review, at a news conference on Friday, Obama suggested Americans would be better off if they hadn’t found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and Internet data.\n“No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,” Obama said. A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn’t know existed.\nThe leaks, he said, hurt that process.\n Conor Friedersdorf, writing for The Atlantic, talks about why pardoning the whistleblower would be more moral and legal than Team Obama’s treatment of Bush-era interrogators:\n Circa 2008, Barack Obama gave his supporters reason to believe that if he were elected, he would protect whistleblowers and obey U.S. law on the subject of torture.\nHe has disappointed on both subjects.\nLong before Edward Snowden exposed mass surveillance on Americans by the NSA, the Obama Administration was aggressively persecuting former civil servants who blew the whistle on objectionable behavior during the Bush Administration.\n Edward Snowden, in A Manifesto for the Truth:\n Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress this debate. They intimidated journalists and criminalized publishing the truth. At this point, the public was not yet able to evaluate the benefits of the revelations. They relied on their governments to decide correctly. […]\nCitizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public importance. To tell the truth is not a crime.\n The American public’s view has been polarized. Here is what Wikipedia’s entry on Edward Snowden says:\n He has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor, and a patriot. Response from US officials has been similarly varied; Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned Snowden’s actions as having done “huge, grave damage” to US intelligence capabilities, while United States Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the NSA had gone “too far” in some of its surveillance activities and promised that it would be stopped.\n  “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”\n— Mark Twain  Rory Carroll, writing for The Guardian, says that the White House has chosen to reject clemency for Edward Snowden.\n The former NSA employee this week appealed for clemency and an opportunity to address members of Congress about US surveillance. He also asked for international help to lobby the US to drop the charges against him. The White House, stung by domestic and international criticism, has shown growing appetite to rein in some of the NSA programmes that Snowden exposed but it has not softened its hostility to the 30-year-old fugitive. […]\nFeinstein, a Democratic senator from California, remained implacable. “He’s done this enormous disservice to our country. I think the answer is ‘no clemency’,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation.\nThe former NSA contractor could have blown the whistle on excesses by contacting the House and Senate intelligence committees, Feinstein said. “We would certainly have seen him … and looked at that information. That didn’t happen.”\n The NSA’s PRISM program   The information that was leaked by Snowden outlined the PRISM program, run by the NSA. Here is what we’ve learned so far.\nChris Gayomali, writing for the The Week, says that “The United States has allegedly been spying on its own allies”.\n Perhaps the most damning new revelation is that the U.S. government may have been spying on friends as well as foes. Thirty-eight embassies and missions are outlined as “targets” on one document, reports the Guardian.\n Also that “PRISM allegedly collects data from companies in real time”.\n The Post suggests the FBI uses “government equipment on private company property” to retrieve information on a specified target, before it is then passed on to “customers” in either the NSA, CIA, or FBI. If true, this ostensibly allows the government’s data collection to proceed in real time. To refresh your memory: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, PayTalk, AOL, Skype, and YouTube were all reported to be taking part in the PRISM program.\nAnd yet, all the companies have “strenuously denied” involvement, says Mike Masnick at TechDirt, which doesn’t jibe with the Post’s own annotations. Based on the slides, “it’s not at all clear” that Data Intercept Technology Units (DITU) are physically located on private the premises of private companies:\n Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the “DITU” could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders. [TechDirt]\n  The Washington Post, in an article entitled “NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program”, shows slides from a classified presentation about PRISM’s purpose.\n The top-secret PRISM program allows the U.S. intelligence community to gain access from nine Internet companies to a wide range of digital information, including e-mails and stored data, on foreign targets operating outside the United States. The program is court-approved but does not require individual warrants. Instead, it operates under a broader authorization from federal judges who oversee the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Some documents describing the program were first released by The Washington Post on June 6. The newly released documents below give additional details about how the program operates, including the levels of review and supervisory control at the NSA and FBI. The documents also show how the program interacts with the Internet companies. These slides, annotated by The Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and certain portions are redacted.\n This presentation lists Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple as being the sources of data for PRISM.\n  Joshua Brustein, writing for Bloomberg Businessweek, has collected statements from all of the companies named in the leaked NSA documents.\n In a series of terse statement (sic), all the companies named in the reports about NSA’s Internet snooping program, Prism, have denied involvement. All these companies have been compelled to share personal data with the government at some time, which they tacitly acknowledge by saying they only do so after careful consideration and court orders. “Direct access” to servers, though, is a bridge too far, they say […].\n Dara Kerr, writing for CNET, says that “The tech giants [Apple, Google, Microsoft], along with Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL, call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to substantially reform the US government’s mass surveillance practices.”\n Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL penned a letter (pdf) to the lead members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday urging the lawmakers to substantially reform the NSA surveillance practices. The companies also asked for additional oversight and accountability mechanisms for the spying programs.\n“Transparency is a critical first step to an informed public debate, but it is clear that more needs to be done,” the letter reads. “We urge the Administration to work with Congress in addressing these critical reforms that would provide much needed transparency and help rebuild the trust of Internet users around the world.” […]\nThat document leak opened the public’s eyes to the government’s collection of data on US residents through both cellular records and metadata from Internet companies. Since Snowden’s original leak, thousands more documents have surfaced. The NSA and the Obama administration have maintained that the surveillance program was carried out to protect Americans and track down foreign terrorists.\n The piece continues, showing precisely how good intentions mean nothing in the real world.\n The letter sent by the tech companies “applauds” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) who recently sponsored a bill called the USA Freedom Act. This bill has the goal of “ending eavesdropping, dragnet collection, and online monitoring” by the NSA and other government agencies.\nSensenbrenner is considered one of the architects of the Patriot Act, which the NSA often cites as a legal justification for its surveillance activities. However, Sensenbrenner is adamant that mass government spying wasn’t the intention of the Patriot Act.\n“We have to make a balance between security and civil liberties,” Sensenbrenner told the Associated Press in an interview last week. “And the reason the intelligence community has gotten itself into such trouble is they apparently do not see why civil liberties have got to be protected.”\n Isn’t that against the law? You’ve asked a very complex question.\nIf you read up on FISA and its various amendments, it is very clear that for the American government to get information from American companies on American soil, they have to provide probable cause and get a warrant from a judge.\n  What they’ve done is not break the law, but rather go around it. The Guardian has an excellent presentation entitled “NSA Files: Decoded. What the revelations mean for you.” which does a terrific job explaining everything. I would encourage you to take some time learning from it.\n Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.\n What the NSA has done is partner with GCHQ (Britain’s equivalent agency) to tap the private fiber-optic cables that transfer digital data from continent to continent.\nInstead of the American government getting information from American companies on American soil, they’re getting it on British soil — which negates all of the oversight protections that American citizens expect.\nThe British parliament was very aware of the power they had over their own people, and colluded with the NSA to dodge American law. While it’s not technically a violation of FISA (which itself is being contested as unconstitutional), it is absolutely a violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n The ACLU published a piece entitled “Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act” which explains how the Patriot Act violates our Constitutional rights.\nWith regard to “Expanded access to personal records held by third parties”:\n Section 215 of the Patriot Act violates the Constitution in several ways. It:\n  Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.\n  Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.\n  Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.\n  Violates the Fourth Amendment by failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n   With regard to “secret searches”:\n The Patriot Act, however, unconstitutionally amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed. This means that the government can enter a house, apartment or office with a search warrant when the occupants are away, search through their property, take photographs, and in some cases even seize property - and not tell them until later.\nNotice is a crucial check on the government’s power because it forces the authorities to operate in the open, and allows the subject of searches to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. For example, it allows them to point out irregularities in a warrant, such as the fact that the police are at the wrong address, or that the scope of the warrant is being exceeded (for example, by rifling through dresser drawers in a search for a stolen car).\n With regard to “Expansion of the intelligence exception in wiretap law”:\n A 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) created an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for probable cause when the purpose of a wiretap or search was to gather foreign intelligence. The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\n With regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\n Under the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” […]\nWeb addresses are rich and revealing content. The URLs or “addresses” of the Web pages we read are not really addresses, they are the titles of documents that we download from the Internet. When we “visit” a Web page what we are really doing is downloading that page from the Internet onto our computer, where it is displayed. […] That is much richer information than a simple list of the people we have communicated with; it is intimate information that reveals who we are and what we are thinking about - much more like the content of a phone call than the number dialed. After all, it is often said that reading is a “conversation” with the author.\n In order for a federal law to be recognized as unconstitutional, a court case needs to go before the U.S. Supreme Court to be decided. Not many court cases against a federal agency have been able to make it that far, but on occasion, something gets caught.\n In January 2009, the FISA court was notified that the NSA had been querying business records metadata “in a manner that appear[ed] to the Court to be directly contrary” to the court’s order allowing it to so. In response, the FISA court ordered the government to explain itself. These documents detail this exchange as the NSA struggled to understand the business records program and ensure compliance.\n “The court is exceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its order in this matter and, while the court will not direct that specific officials of the executive branch provide sworn declarations in response to this order, the court expects that the declarants will be officials of sufficient stature that they have the authority to speak on behalf of the executive branch.”\n— Reggie Walton   Using this interactive diagram, you can see which laws, amendments and executive orders have enabled the NSA to operate as it currently does.\nSo, what are Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple doing about this? First of all, it needs to be clear that they never knowingly gave this kind of information to the NSA. The NSA colluded with the GCHQ to subvert American law by directly tapping the fiber optic cables that sends data between continents.\n GCHQ offices in England, UK\n Barton Gellman, Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson, writing for The Washington Post, explain “How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data” (emphasis mine).\n Immediately after the story posted online, a reporter asked NSA Director Keith B. Alexander about it at a cybersecurity event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Neither the reporter nor Alexander had read the story yet.\n General, we’re getting some news that’s crossing right now being reported in The Washington Post that there are new Snowden allegations that say the NSA broke into Yahoo and Google’s databases worldwide, that they infiltrated these databases?\n Alexander replied:\n That’s never happened. […] This is not the NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that. And so I don’t know what the report is, but I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\n The story did not say the NSA breaks into “servers” or “databases.” It said the agency, working with its British counterpart, intercepts communications that run on private circuits between the fortress-like data centers that each company operates on multiple continents.\nThe distinction is between “data at rest” and “data on the fly.” The NSA and GCHQ do not break into user accounts that are stored on Yahoo and Google computers. They intercept the information as it travels over fiber optic cables from one data center to another. […]\nThe two companies do not entrust their data center communications to the “public internet,” which is comparable to an international highway system that anyone can use. Instead, they link their data centers with thousands of miles of privately owned or privately leased fiber optic cable – in effect, a system of private highways. When Google and Yahoo have to share a stretch of road with the public internet, they take other precautions to keep their traffic secure. […]\nOur Wednesday story noted that the NSA is governed by fewer rules and less oversight when it does its intelligence collection outside U.S. territory:\n Intercepting communications overseas has clear advantages for the NSA, with looser restrictions and less oversight. NSA documents about the effort refer directly to “full take,” “bulk access” and “high volume” operations on Yahoo and Google networks. Such large-scale collection of Internet content would be illegal in the United States, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA is allowed to presume that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner.\nOutside U.S. territory, statutory restrictions on surveillance seldom apply and the FISC has no jurisdiction. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has acknowledged that Congress conducts little oversight of intelligence-gathering under the presidential authority of Executive Order 12333, which defines the basic powers and responsibilities of the intelligence agencies.\n  (EO 12333 was signed by Ronald Reagan . It was superseded and amended by EO 13355 and EO 13470, both signed by George W. Bush.)\nBrandon Downey , a security engineer at Google, had this to say:\n Fuck these guys.\nI’ve spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google’s users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces. […]\nIt makes me sad because I believe in America.\nNot in that flag-waving bullshit we’ve-got-our-big-trucks-and-bigger-tanks sort of way, but in the way that you can looked a good friend who has a lot of flaws, but every time you meet him, you think, “That guy still has some good ideas going on”.\nBut after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google — one of the greatest things to arise from the internet — seeing this, well, it’s just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\n Mike Hearn , another security engineer at Google, had this to say:\n I now join him in issuing a giant Fuck You to the people who made these slides. I am not American, I am a Brit, but it’s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.\nWe designed this system to keep criminals out. There’s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we’ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.\nUnfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.\nThank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\n Later, in the comments of his post, he explains the following:\n Encryption was being worked on prior to Snowden but it didn’t seem like a high priority because there was no evidence it would achieve anything useful, and it cost a lot of resources. Once it became clear how badly compromised the fiber paths were, there was a crash effort to encrypt everything.\n Sean Gallagher, writing for Ars Technica, says that “Googlers say ‘F*** you’ to NSA, company encrypts internal network”.\n Google has started to encrypt its traffic between its data centers, effectively halting the broad surveillance of its inner workings by the joint National Security Agency-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR. The move turns off a giant source of information to the two agencies, which at one point accounted for nearly a third of the NSA’s daily data intake for its primary intelligence analysis database—at least for now.\nAs of 2012, the NSA developed “defeat fingerprints” to scan the server-to-server communications that powered Google Adwords, Blogger, the BigTable database that powers Google Drive and other applications, and the TeraGoogle search index interface. These fingerprints allowed the NSA to scan Google internal traffic and identify elements associated with the usage of specific individuals or for searches and other behavior around a particular subject of interest (like, say, “pressure cooker bomb”). […]\nA second set of NSA tools, called Serendipity, gave the agency the ability to target specific Google accounts for monitoring as they accessed service, including:\n Chrome synchronization, including bookmark sync to the cloud “Talkgadget,” the Google Talk component of Gmail The now-defunct iGoogle personalized pages Google searches Picasa photo sharing YouTube […]  For Yahoo, the NSA had developed another set of hooks, fully accessing its internal mail protocols as well as its Messenger instant messaging service, advertising tracker, and “Web beacons” used to track whether users had opened HTML-formatted emails. And the agency had to respond to a flood of unwanted data from these sources by instituting blocks—mostly to deal with Yahoo’s periodic movement of entire user mailboxes.\n Chris Baraniuk, writing for Wired, says that Microsoft still doesn’t encrypt server-to-server data.\n A senior Microsoft executive has told a European parliamentary committee that the company does not encrypt its server-to-server data communications.\nDorothee Belz, EMEA VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, made the remark when answering a question from Claude Moraes, MEP, during a meeting at the European Parliament on Monday.\n“Generally, what I can say today is server-to-server transportation is generally not encrypted,” she said. “This is why we are currently reviewing our security system.” […]\nIt’s just one of several leaks by former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden that has concerned the EU’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) in a series of parliamentary hearings.\nPrior to taking questions from MEPs, Belz, who appeared alongside executives from Google and Facebook, reiterated earlier statements from Microsoft by stressing that the company did not openly provide “direct access” to its servers. However, her later admission that the firm has as yet failed to establish server-to-server encryption has raised fears among many within digital liberties groups that a significant breach of privacy could still be perpetrated.\nSam Smith, a technologist at Privacy International, said the unencrypted data could hypothetically relate to any of Microsoft’s cloud services, from Hotmail and Outlook.com email accounts to Xbox Live, Office 365, and SkyDrive cloud storage.\n What now?   The debate Snowden wanted is happening. That in itself is a major achievement.\n Public opinion is polarized over surveillance, but polls show a jump in concern over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations. A Pew poll at the end of July found that for the first time in a decade, the majority of Americans are more concerned about the government infringing on their civil liberties than about a potential terrorist attack. […]\nAccording to a recent study, the majority of Americans believe that preserving the rights of US citizens is more important than preventing terrorist attacks. Since the NSA revelations, Americans have become more opposed to government surveillance that infringes on civil liberties.\n People are turning to the court system more and more.\n In the end, it may be through the courts rather than Congress that genuine reform may come. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched lawsuits that have led to disclosure of hundreds of pages of Fisa (sic) rulings on Section 215. GCHQ and NSA surveillance is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights from Big Brother Watch, English PEN and Open Rights Group.\nSilicon Valley is also taking action through the courts. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, facing a backlash from their users in the US and overseas over mass surveillance, are fighting to be allowed to be more transparent about their dealings with the intelligence agencies. These companies, along with Facebook, Apple and AOL have also written to the Senate intelligence committee demanding reform.\n With as much hate and backbiting I’ve seen among American citizens and Congressional members since 2000, something strange has happened around this issue.\n There are now several major pieces of legislation going through Congress that would introduce at least some reform of the NSA. Among those, the one backed by Feinstein and passed by her committee is the least radical, offering proposals for greater transparency but basically maintaining the status quo. The bulk collection of Americans’ phone call data would be enshrined in US law.\nMore far-reaching is the proposed Intelligence Oversight and Reform Act, with bipartisan support from senators Wyden, Udall, Richard Blumenthal and Rand Paul. It would ban the collection of internet communication data; close loopholes that allow snooping on Americans without a warrant; reform the Fisa court; and provide some protection for companies faced with handing over data to the NSA.\n What about Edward Snowden? After leaving Hawai’i and his job as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong before winding up in Moscow, where Russian President Vladimir Putin granted him temporary asylum and protection from the U.S. government.\nHe most certainly has a rough road ahead of him. There’s no way you can piss-off the U.S. government as badly as he has and plan to remain free forever. Then again, they also said that about Bobby Fischer.\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said:\n “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.”\n I, for one, consider Edward Snowden a hero and a patriot to the highest degree.\nUpdate (2013–12–09) Aol, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! have all gotten together and put forward this new initiative: ReformGovernmentSurviellance.com.\nI’m disappointed that Apple isn’t on this list.\n",

The law does not apply outside the United States. It has been repeatedly amended since the September 11 attacks.\n\nFISA was amended in 2001 by [The Patriot Act]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act\" %}}):\n\n\u003e The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 is an Act of Congress that was signed into law by President {{\u003c person name=\"George W. Bush\" \u003e}} on October 26, 2001. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e On May 26, 2011, President {{\u003c person name=\"Barack Obama\" \u003e}} signed the PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a four-year extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the “library records provision”), and conducting surveillance of “lone wolves”—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.\n\nThen again by the [Protect America Act of 2007]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_America_Act_of_2007\" %}}):\n\n\u003e The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), (Pub.L. 110–55, 121 Stat. 552, enacted by S. 1927), is a controversial amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on August 5, 2007. It removed the warrant requirement for government surveillance of foreign intelligence targets “reasonably believed” to be outside of the United States. The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 reauthorized many provisions of the Protect America Act in Title VII of FISA.\n\nAnd yet again by the [FISA Amendments Act of 2008]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FISA_Amendments_Act_of_2008\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Warrantless wiretapping by the National Security Agency (NSA) was revealed publicly in late 2005 by the New York Times and then discontinued in January 2007. \\[…\\] Approximately forty lawsuits have been filed against telecommunications companies by groups and individuals alleging that the Bush administration illegally monitored their phone calls or e-mails. Whistleblower evidence suggests that AT\u0026T was complicit in the NSA’s warrantless surveillance, which could have involved the private communications of millions of Americans.\n\u003e\n\u003e The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it illegal to intentionally engage in electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act or to disclose or use information obtained by electronic surveillance under appearance of an official act knowing that it was not authorized by statute; this is punishable with a fine of up to * 10,000 or up to five years in prison, or both. In addition, the Wiretap Act prohibits any person from illegally intercepting, disclosing, using, or divulging phone calls or electronic communications; this is punishable with a fine or up to five years in prison, or both.\n\n(All 3 sets of amendments to FISA were passed by Congresses operating during the George W. Bush administration.)\n\n\n## {{\u003c person name=\"Edward Snowden\" \u003e}}, Whistleblower\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/snowden@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nIn May 2013, {{\u003c person name=\"Edward Snowden\" \u003e}}’s leak of *Top Secret*-level NSA material was called [“the most significant leak in U.S. history”]({{% wayback \"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/10/edward-snowden-daniel-ellsberg-whistleblower-history_n_3413545.html\" %}}) by Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers (1971).\n\nThe U.S. government has [charged Snowden with espionage]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-charges-snowden-with-espionage/2013/06/21/507497d8-dab1-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html\" %}}) and [theft of government secrets]({{% wayback \"http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/world/us-vs-edward-j-snowden-criminal-complaint/496/\" %}}). President Obama’s response was reported by Z. Byron Wolf, [writing for CNN]({{% wayback \"http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower/\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Even as he announced changes to the NSA programs, including the appointment of an independent government review, at a news conference on Friday, Obama suggested Americans would be better off if they hadn’t found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and Internet data.\n\u003e\n\u003e “No, I don’t think Mr. Snowden was a patriot,” Obama said. A bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most Americans didn’t know existed.\n\u003e\n\u003e The leaks, he said, hurt that process.\n\nConor Friedersdorf, [writing for The Atlantic]({{% wayback \"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/11/clemency-for-torturers-but-not-for-edward-snowden/281142/\" %}}), talks about why pardoning the whistleblower would be more moral and legal than Team Obama’s treatment of Bush-era interrogators:\n\n\u003e Circa 2008, Barack Obama gave his supporters reason to believe that if he were elected, he would protect whistleblowers and obey U.S. law on the subject of torture.\n\u003e\n\u003e He has disappointed on both subjects.\n\u003e\n\u003e Long before Edward Snowden exposed mass surveillance on Americans by the NSA, the Obama Administration was aggressively persecuting former civil servants who blew the whistle on objectionable behavior during the Bush Administration.\n\nEdward Snowden, in [A Manifesto for the Truth]({{% wayback \"http://www.globalresearch.ca/a-manifesto-for-the-truth/5356919\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Society can only understand and control these problems through an open, respectful and informed debate. At first, some governments feeling embarrassed by the revelations of mass surveillance initiated an unprecedented campaign of persecution to supress this debate. They intimidated journalists and criminalized publishing the truth. At this point, the public was not yet able to evaluate the benefits of the revelations. They relied on their governments to decide correctly. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Citizens have to fight suppression of information on matters of vital public importance. To tell the truth is not a crime.\n\nThe American public’s view has been polarized. Here is what [Wikipedia’s entry on Edward Snowden]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden\" %}}) says:\n\n\u003e He has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a traitor, and a patriot. Response from US officials has been similarly varied; Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned Snowden’s actions as having done “huge, grave damage” to US intelligence capabilities, while United States Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that the NSA had gone “too far” in some of its surveillance activities and promised that it would be stopped.\n\n\u003e “Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it.”\n\u003e\n\u003e — {{\u003c person name=\"Mark Twain\" \u003e}}\n\nRory Carroll, [writing for The Guardian]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/white-house-nsa-edward-snowden-clemency\" %}}), says that the White House has chosen to reject clemency for Edward Snowden.\n\n\u003e The former NSA employee this week appealed for clemency and an opportunity to address members of Congress about US surveillance. He also asked for international help to lobby the US to drop the charges against him. The White House, stung by domestic and international criticism, has shown growing appetite to rein in some of the NSA programmes that Snowden exposed but it has not softened its hostility to the 30-year-old fugitive. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Feinstein, a Democratic senator from California, remained implacable. “He’s done this enormous disservice to our country. I think the answer is ‘no clemency’,” she told CBS’s Face the Nation.\n\u003e\n\u003e The former NSA contractor could have blown the whistle on excesses by contacting the House and Senate intelligence committees, Feinstein said. “We would certainly have seen him … and looked at that information. That didn’t happen.”\n\n\n## The NSA’s PRISM program\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/prism@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nThe information that was leaked by Snowden outlined the PRISM program, run by the NSA. Here is what we’ve learned so far.\n\nChris Gayomali, [writing for the The Week]({{% wayback \"http://theweek.com/article/index/246349/3-big-revelations-from-the-newly-leaked-nsa-documents\" %}}), says that “The United States has allegedly been spying on its own allies”.\n\n\u003e Perhaps the most damning new revelation is that the U.S. government may have been spying on friends as well as foes. Thirty-eight embassies and missions are outlined as “targets” on one document, reports the Guardian.\n\nAlso that “PRISM allegedly collects data from companies in real time”.\n\n\u003e The Post suggests the FBI uses “government equipment on private company property” to retrieve information on a specified target, before it is then passed on to “customers” in either the NSA, CIA, or FBI. If true, this ostensibly allows the government’s data collection to proceed in real time. To refresh your memory: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, PayTalk, AOL, Skype, and YouTube were all reported to be taking part in the PRISM program.\n\u003e\n\u003e And yet, all the companies have “strenuously denied” involvement, says Mike Masnick at TechDirt, which doesn’t jibe with the Post’s own annotations. Based on the slides, “it’s not at all clear” that Data Intercept Technology Units (DITU) are physically located on private the premises of private companies:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e Google has said in the past that when it receives a valid FISA court order under the associated program it uses secure FTP to ship the info to the government. From that, it seems like the “DITU” could just be a government computer somewhere, not on the premises of these companies, and info is uploaded to those servers following valid FISC orders. \\[[TechDirt]({{% wayback \"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130701/00444723675/newly-leaked-nsa-slides-prism-add-to-confusion-rather-than-clear-it-up.shtml\" %}})\\]\n\n*The Washington Post*, in an article entitled [“NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program”]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/\" %}}), shows slides from a classified presentation about PRISM’s purpose.\n\n\u003e The top-secret PRISM program allows the U.S. intelligence community to gain access from nine Internet companies to a wide range of digital information, including e-mails and stored data, on foreign targets operating outside the United States. The program is court-approved but does not require individual warrants. Instead, it operates under a broader authorization from federal judges who oversee the use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Some documents describing the program were first released by The Washington Post on June 6. The newly released documents below give additional details about how the program operates, including the levels of review and supervisory control at the NSA and FBI. The documents also show how the program interacts with the Internet companies. These slides, annotated by The Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and certain portions are redacted.\n\nThis presentation lists Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple as being the sources of data for PRISM.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/prism-affected.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nJoshua Brustein, [writing for Bloomberg Businessweek]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-07/the-companies-lines-on-prism\" %}}), has collected statements from all of the companies named in the leaked NSA documents.\n\n\u003e In a series of terse statement *(sic)*, all the companies named in the reports about NSA’s Internet snooping program, Prism, have denied involvement. All these companies have been compelled to share personal data with the government at some time, which they tacitly acknowledge by saying they only do so after careful consideration and court orders. “Direct access” to servers, though, is a bridge too far, they say \\[…\\].\n\nDara Kerr, [writing for CNET]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57610342-83/apple-google-microsoft-unite-against-nsa-spying-program/\" %}}), says that “The tech giants \\[Apple, Google, Microsoft\\], along with Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL, call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to substantially reform the US government’s mass surveillance practices.”\n\n\u003e Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and AOL penned a letter ([pdf]({{% wayback \"http://www.scribd.com/doc/180596438/USA-Freedom-Act-Letter-10-31-13-pdf\" %}})) to the lead members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday urging the lawmakers to substantially reform the NSA surveillance practices. The companies also asked for additional oversight and accountability mechanisms for the spying programs.\n\u003e\n\u003e “Transparency is a critical first step to an informed public debate, but it is clear that more needs to be done,” the letter reads. “We urge the Administration to work with Congress in addressing these critical reforms that would provide much needed transparency and help rebuild the trust of Internet users around the world.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e That document leak opened the public’s eyes to the government’s collection of data on US residents through both cellular records and metadata from Internet companies. Since Snowden’s original leak, thousands more documents have surfaced. The NSA and the Obama administration have maintained that the surveillance program was carried out to protect Americans and track down foreign terrorists.\n\nThe piece continues, showing precisely how good intentions mean nothing in the real world.\n\n\u003e The letter sent by the tech companies “applauds” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) who recently sponsored a bill called the USA Freedom Act. This bill has the goal of “ending eavesdropping, dragnet collection, and online monitoring” by the NSA and other government agencies.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sensenbrenner is considered one of the architects of the Patriot Act, which the NSA often cites as a legal justification for its surveillance activities. However, Sensenbrenner is adamant that mass government spying wasn’t the intention of the Patriot Act.\n\u003e\n\u003e “We have to make a balance between security and civil liberties,” Sensenbrenner told the Associated Press in an interview last week. “And the reason the intelligence community has gotten itself into such trouble is they apparently do not see why civil liberties have got to be protected.”\n\n\n## Isn’t that against the law?\n\nYou’ve asked a very complex question.\n\nIf you read up on FISA and its various amendments, it is very clear that for the American government to get information from American companies on American soil, they have to provide probable cause and get a warrant from a judge.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/fisa@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nWhat they’ve done is not break the law, but rather *go around it*. *The Guardian* has an excellent presentation entitled [“NSA Files: Decoded. What the revelations mean for you.”]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded\" %}}) which does a terrific job explaining everything. I would encourage you to take some time learning from it.\n\n\u003e Much of the NSA’s defence is that the public should be unconcerned, summed up by the dictum: “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows.\n\nWhat the NSA has done is partner with [GCHQ]({{% wayback \"http://www.gchq.gov.uk\" %}}) (Britain’s equivalent agency) to tap the private fiber-optic cables that transfer digital data from continent to continent.\n\nInstead of the American government getting information from American companies on American soil, they’re getting it on *British soil* — which negates all of the oversight protections that American citizens expect.\n\nThe British parliament was [very aware of the power they had over their own people]({{% wayback \"http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/mps-admit-they-knew-how-powerful-gchq-had-become-1-3181385\" %}}), and colluded with the NSA to dodge American law. While it’s not *technically* a violation of FISA (which itself is being contested as unconstitutional), it is *absolutely* a violation of the of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u003e “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\n\nThe ACLU published a piece entitled [“Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act”]({{% wayback \"https://www.aclu.org/national-security/surveillance-under-usa-patriot-act\" %}}) which explains how the Patriot Act violates our Constitutional rights.\n\nWith regard to “Expanded access to personal records held by third parties”:\n\n\u003e Section 215 of the Patriot Act violates the Constitution in several ways. It:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the Fourth Amendment, which says the government cannot conduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause to believe that the person has committed or will commit a crime.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders from telling others about those orders, even where there is no real need for secrecy.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the First Amendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations of American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.\n\u003e\n\u003e * Violates the Fourth Amendment by failing to provide notice - even after the fact - to persons whose privacy has been compromised. Notice is also a key element of due process, which is guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nWith regard to “secret searches”:\n\n\u003e The Patriot Act, however, unconstitutionally amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed. This means that the government can enter a house, apartment or office with a search warrant when the occupants are away, search through their property, take photographs, and in some cases even seize property - and not tell them until later.\n\u003e\n\u003e Notice is a crucial check on the government’s power because it forces the authorities to operate in the open, and allows the subject of searches to protect their Fourth Amendment rights. For example, it allows them to point out irregularities in a warrant, such as the fact that the police are at the wrong address, or that the scope of the warrant is being exceeded (for example, by rifling through dresser drawers in a search for a stolen car).\n\nWith regard to “Expansion of the intelligence exception in wiretap law”:\n\n\u003e A 1978 law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) created an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s requirement for probable cause when the purpose of a wiretap or search was to gather foreign intelligence. The rationale was that since the search was not conducted for the purpose of gathering evidence to put someone on trial, the standards could be loosened. In a stark demonstration of why it can be dangerous to create exceptions to fundamental rights, however, the Patriot Act expanded this once-narrow exception to cover wiretaps and searches that DO collect evidence for regular domestic criminal cases. FISA previously allowed searches only if the primary purpose was to gather foreign intelligence. But the Patriot Act changes the law to allow searches when “a significant purpose” is intelligence. That lets the government circumvent the Constitution’s probable cause requirement even when its main goal is ordinary law enforcement.\n\nWith regard to “Expansion of the ‘pen register’ exception in wiretap law”:\n\n\u003e Under the Patriot Act PR/TT orders issued by a judge are no longer valid only in that judge’s jurisdiction, but can be made valid anywhere in the United States. This “nationwide service” further marginalizes the role of the judiciary, because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used. In addition, this provision authorizes the equivalent of a blank warrant: the court issues the order, and the law enforcement agent fills in the places to be searched. That is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment’s explicit requirement that warrants be written “particularly describing the place to be searched.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Web addresses are rich and revealing content. The URLs or “addresses” of the Web pages we read are not really addresses, they are the titles of documents that we download from the Internet. When we “visit” a Web page what we are really doing is downloading that page from the Internet onto our computer, where it is displayed. \\[…\\] That is much richer information than a simple list of the people we have communicated with; it is intimate information that reveals who we are and what we are thinking about - much more like the content of a phone call than the number dialed. After all, it is often said that reading is a “conversation” with the author.\n\nIn order for a federal law to be recognized as unconstitutional, a court case needs to go before the U.S. Supreme Court to be decided. Not many court cases against a federal agency have been able to make it that far, but on occasion, [something gets caught]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#interactive/7\" %}}).\n\n\u003e In January 2009, the FISA court was notified that the NSA had been querying business records metadata “in a manner that appear\\[ed\\] to the Court to be directly contrary” to the court’s order allowing it to so. In response, the FISA court ordered the government to explain itself. These documents detail this exchange as the NSA struggled to understand the business records program and ensure compliance.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e “The court is exceptionally concerned about what appears to be a flagrant violation of its order in this matter and, while the court will not direct that specific officials of the executive branch provide sworn declarations in response to this order, the court expects that the declarants will be officials of sufficient stature that they have the authority to speak on behalf of the executive branch.”\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e — {{\u003c person name=\"Reggie Walton\" \u003e}}\n\nUsing [this interactive diagram]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#interactive/14\" %}}), you can see which laws, amendments and executive orders have enabled the NSA to operate as it currently does.\n\n\n## So, what are Microsoft, Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, YouTube, Skype, AOL and Apple doing about this?\n\nFirst of all, it needs to be clear that **they never knowingly gave this kind of information to the NSA**. The NSA colluded with the GCHQ to subvert American law by directly tapping the fiber optic cables that sends data between continents.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/gchq-building@2x.jpg\" figure=\"GCHQ offices in England, UK\"\u003e}}\n\nBarton Gellman, Ashkan Soltani and Andrea Peterson, [writing for The Washington Post]({{% wayback \"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/04/how-we-know-the-nsa-had-access-to-internal-google-and-yahoo-cloud-data/\" %}}), explain “How we know the NSA had access to internal Google and Yahoo cloud data” (emphasis **mine**).\n\n\u003e Immediately after the story posted online, a reporter asked NSA Director Keith B. Alexander about it at a cybersecurity event hosted by Bloomberg Government. Neither the reporter nor Alexander had read the story yet.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e General, we’re getting some news that’s crossing right now being reported in The Washington Post that there are new Snowden allegations that say the NSA broke into Yahoo and Google’s databases worldwide, that they infiltrated these databases?\n\u003e\n\u003e Alexander replied:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e That’s never happened. \\[…\\] This is not the NSA breaking into any databases. It would be illegal for us to do that. And so I don’t know what the report is, but I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers.\n\u003e\n\u003e The story did not say the NSA breaks into “servers” or “databases.” It said the agency, working with its British counterpart, **intercepts communications that run on private circuits between the fortress-like data centers that each company operates on multiple continents**.\n\u003e\n\u003e The distinction is between “data at rest” and “data on the fly.” The NSA and GCHQ do not break into user accounts that are stored on Yahoo and Google computers. **They intercept the information as it travels over fiber optic cables from one data center to another**. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e The two companies do not entrust their data center communications to the “public internet,” which is comparable to an international highway system that anyone can use. **Instead, they link their data centers with thousands of miles of privately owned or privately leased fiber optic cable – in effect, a system of private highways.** When Google and Yahoo have to share a stretch of road with the public internet, they take other precautions to keep their traffic secure. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Our Wednesday story noted that the NSA is governed by fewer rules and less oversight when it does its intelligence collection outside U.S. territory:\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003e Intercepting communications overseas has clear advantages for the NSA, with looser restrictions and less oversight. **NSA documents about the effort refer directly to “full take,” “bulk access” and “high volume” operations on Yahoo and Google networks.** Such large-scale collection of Internet content would be illegal in the United States, but the operations take place overseas, where the NSA is allowed to presume that anyone using a foreign data link is a foreigner.\n\u003e \u003e\n\u003e \u003e Outside U.S. territory, statutory restrictions on surveillance seldom apply and the FISC has no jurisdiction. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has acknowledged that **Congress conducts little oversight of intelligence-gathering under the presidential authority of Executive Order 12333, which defines the basic powers and responsibilities of the intelligence agencies**.\n\n([EO 12333]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333\" %}}) was signed by {{\u003c person name=\"Ronald Reagan\" \u003e}}. It was superseded and amended by [EO 13355]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13355\" %}}) and [EO 13470]({{% wayback \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13470\" %}}), both signed by George W. Bush.)\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Brandon Downey\" \u003e}}, a security engineer at Google, [had this to say]({{% wayback \"https://plus.google.com/108799184931623330498/posts/SfYy8xbDWGG\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Fuck these guys.\n\u003e\n\u003e I’ve spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google’s users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e It makes me sad because I believe in America.\n\u003e\n\u003e Not in that flag-waving bullshit we’ve-got-our-big-trucks-and-bigger-tanks sort of way, but in the way that you can looked a good friend who has a lot of flaws, but every time you meet him, you think, “That guy still has some good ideas going on”.\n\u003e\n\u003e But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google — one of the greatest things to arise from the internet — seeing this, well, it’s just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Mike Hearn\" \u003e}}, another security engineer at Google, [had this to say]({{% wayback \"https://plus.google.com/+MikeHearn/posts/LW1DXJ2BK8k\" %}}):\n\n\u003e I now join him in issuing a giant Fuck You to the people who made these slides. I am not American, I am a Brit, but it’s no different - GCHQ turns out to be even worse than the NSA.\n\u003e\n\u003e We designed this system to keep criminals out. There’s no ambiguity here. The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal, and rules of evidence was built from centuries of hard won experience. When it works, it represents as good a balance as we’ve got between the need to restrain the state and the need to keep crime in check. Bypassing that system is illegal for a good reason.\n\u003e\n\u003e Unfortunately we live in a world where all too often, laws are for the little people. Nobody at GCHQ or the NSA will ever stand before a judge and answer for this industrial-scale subversion of the judicial process. In the absence of working law enforcement, we therefore do what internet engineers have always done - build more secure software. The traffic shown in the slides below is now all encrypted and the work the NSA/GCHQ staff did on understanding it, ruined.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you Edward Snowden. For me personally, this is the most interesting revelation all summer.\n\nLater, in the comments of his post, he explains the following:\n\n\u003e Encryption was being worked on prior to Snowden but it didn’t seem like a high priority because there was no evidence it would achieve anything useful, and it cost a lot of resources. Once it became clear how badly compromised the fiber paths were, there was a crash effort to encrypt everything.\n\nSean Gallagher, [writing for Ars Technica]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/googlers-say-f-you-to-nsa-company-encrypts-internal-network/\" %}}), says that “Googlers say ‘F\\*\\*\\* you’ to NSA, company encrypts internal network”.\n\n\u003e Google has started to encrypt its traffic between its data centers, effectively halting the broad surveillance of its inner workings by the joint National Security Agency-GCHQ program known as MUSCULAR. The move turns off a giant source of information to the two agencies, which at one point accounted for nearly a third of the NSA’s daily data intake for its primary intelligence analysis database—at least for now.\n\u003e\n\u003e As of 2012, the NSA developed “defeat fingerprints” to scan the server-to-server communications that powered Google Adwords, Blogger, the BigTable database that powers Google Drive and other applications, and the TeraGoogle search index interface. These fingerprints allowed the NSA to scan Google internal traffic and identify elements associated with the usage of specific individuals or for searches and other behavior around a particular subject of interest (like, say, “pressure cooker bomb”). \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e A second set of NSA tools, called Serendipity, gave the agency the ability to target specific Google accounts for monitoring as they accessed service, including:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Chrome synchronization, including bookmark sync to the cloud\n\u003e * “Talkgadget,” the Google Talk component of Gmail\n\u003e * The now-defunct iGoogle personalized pages\n\u003e * Google searches\n\u003e * Picasa photo sharing\n\u003e * YouTube \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e For Yahoo, the NSA had developed another set of hooks, fully accessing its internal mail protocols as well as its Messenger instant messaging service, advertising tracker, and “Web beacons” used to track whether users had opened HTML-formatted emails. And the agency had to respond to a flood of unwanted data from these sources by instituting blocks—mostly to deal with Yahoo’s periodic movement of entire user mailboxes.\n\nChris Baraniuk, [writing for Wired]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/we-still-dont-encrypt-server-to-server-data-admits-microsoft/\" %}}), says that Microsoft still doesn’t encrypt server-to-server data.\n\n\u003e A senior Microsoft executive has told a European parliamentary committee that the company does not encrypt its server-to-server data communications.\n\u003e\n\u003e Dorothee Belz, EMEA VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, made the remark when answering a question from Claude Moraes, MEP, during a meeting at the European Parliament on Monday.\n\u003e\n\u003e “Generally, what I can say today is server-to-server transportation is generally not encrypted,” she said. “This is why we are currently reviewing our security system.” \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s just one of several leaks by former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden that has concerned the EU’s Committee for Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs (LIBE) in a series of parliamentary hearings.\n\u003e\n\u003e Prior to taking questions from MEPs, Belz, who appeared alongside executives from Google and Facebook, reiterated earlier statements from Microsoft by stressing that the company did not openly provide “direct access” to its servers. However, her later admission that the firm has as yet failed to establish server-to-server encryption has raised fears among many within digital liberties groups that a significant breach of privacy could still be perpetrated.\n\u003e\n\u003e Sam Smith, a technologist at Privacy International, said the unencrypted data could hypothetically relate to any of Microsoft’s cloud services, from Hotmail and Outlook.com email accounts to Xbox Live, Office 365, and SkyDrive cloud storage.\n\n\n## What now?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/hands-off-my-metadata@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n[The debate Snowden wanted is happening]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/snowden-nsa-files-surveillance-revelations-decoded#section/6\" %}}). That in itself is a major achievement.\n\n\u003e Public opinion is polarized over surveillance, but polls show a jump in concern over privacy in the wake of Snowden’s revelations. A [Pew poll at the end of July]({{% wayback \"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/poll-nsa-surveillance-privacy-pew\" %}}) found that for the first time in a decade, the majority of Americans are more concerned about the government infringing on their civil liberties than about a potential terrorist attack. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e According to a recent study, the majority of Americans believe that preserving the rights of US citizens is more important than preventing terrorist attacks. Since the NSA revelations, Americans have become more opposed to government surveillance that infringes on civil liberties.\n\nPeople are turning to the court system more and more.\n\n\u003e In the end, it may be through the courts rather than Congress that genuine reform may come. Privacy groups such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation launched lawsuits that have led to disclosure of hundreds of pages of Fisa *(sic)* rulings on Section 215. GCHQ and NSA surveillance is facing a legal challenge at the European court of human rights from Big Brother Watch, English PEN and Open Rights Group.\n\u003e\n\u003e Silicon Valley is also taking action through the courts. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, facing a backlash from their users in the US and overseas over mass surveillance, are fighting to be allowed to be more transparent about their dealings with the intelligence agencies. These companies, along with Facebook, Apple and AOL have also written to the Senate intelligence committee demanding reform.\n\nWith as much hate and backbiting I’ve seen among American citizens and Congressional members since 2000, something strange has happened around this issue.\n\n\u003e There are now several major pieces of legislation going through Congress that would introduce at least some reform of the NSA. Among those, the one backed by Feinstein and passed by her committee is the least radical, offering proposals for greater transparency but basically maintaining the status quo. The bulk collection of Americans’ phone call data would be enshrined in US law.\n\u003e\n\u003e More far-reaching is the proposed Intelligence Oversight and Reform Act, with bipartisan support from senators Wyden, Udall, Richard Blumenthal and Rand Paul. It would ban the collection of internet communication data; close loopholes that allow snooping on Americans without a warrant; reform the Fisa court; and provide some protection for companies faced with handing over data to the NSA.\n\n\n## What about Edward Snowden?\n\nAfter leaving Hawai’i and his job as an NSA contractor, he fled to Hong Kong before winding up in Moscow, where Russian President {{\u003c person name=\"Vladimir Putin\" \u003e}} granted him temporary asylum and protection from the U.S. government.\n\nHe most certainly has a rough road ahead of him. There’s no way you can piss-off the U.S. government as badly as he has and plan to remain free forever. Then again, they also said that about Bobby Fischer.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\" \u003e}} once said:\n\n\u003e “An individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for the law.”\n\nI, for one, consider Edward Snowden a hero and a patriot to the highest degree.\n\n\n## Update (2013–12–09)\n\nAol, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo! have all gotten together and put forward this new initiative: [ReformGovernmentSurviellance.com]({{% wayback \"http://reformgovernmentsurviellance.com\" %}}).\n\nI’m disappointed that Apple isn’t on this list.\n"},

        "plain":"My friend Michelle recently explained to me that password is a perfectly valid password to use. Her reason? “People always say not to use it. So now that nobody uses it anymore, it’s totally secure again!”   How I’d Hack Your Weak Passwords In this case, Michelle made a fatal assumption. She assumed that human beings would be manually typing in guessed passwords. What she failed to understand is that it’s really, really easy for any off-the-shelf computer to chew through possible passwords at an incredible pace.\nYou know where they start? With password.\n  In an article written for Lifehacker entitled How I’d Hack Your Weak Passwords, author John Pozadzides says the following:\n If you invited me to try and crack your password, you know the one that you use over and over for like every web page you visit, how many guesses would it take before I got it?\nLet’s see… here is my top 10 list. I can obtain most of this information much easier than you think, then I might just be able to get into your e-mail, computer, or online banking. After all, if I get into one I’ll probably get into all of them.\nYour partner, child, or pet’s name, possibly followed by a 0 or 1 (because they’re always making you use a number, aren’t they?)\n The last 4 digits of your social security number. 123 or 1234 or 123456. “password” Your city, or college, football team name. Date of birth – yours, your partner’s or your child’s. “god” “letmein” “money” “love”  Statistically speaking that should probably cover about 20% of you. But don’t worry. If I didn’t get it yet it will probably only take a few more minutes before I do…\n Everything you know (about passwords) is wrong Michelle and I share a cell phone plan. The other day, she asked me for the account info so that she could login and do some stuff. So I gave her my information (because I trust her).\n Username: my.email@address.com Password: cVWXDD$XkA25eZo437F£$^Xp (not my real password)  She flipped-out on me. “Who’s going to try to hack into your AT\u0026amp;T account?!” I tried to explain how that wasn’t the point, but she’d already moved on to the next shiny object.\n  I talked a couple of months ago about how I’d changed every single password I have. Why? Because I was re-using the same passwords all over the place, and it was time to fix that.\n In short, one of my hard-to-guess-but-used-in-lots-of-places passwords was one of the ones that was obtained by hackers. As such, I had the fine work ahead of me to change the password for every single site that used the password that got hacked.\n1Password to the rescue! It took me about 90 minutes, but I was able to lookup all of the sites where this password was being used, and change the password for all of them. This event ended up making me re-think how I managed my passwords.\n It’s not that anybody would care about my AT\u0026amp;T account. It’s that if I re-use the same password across multiple websites, it increases the likelihood that if a site gets hacked, that they can use that information to access other sites where you use that password.\nWe need to start doing a better job Going back to the piece by John Pozadzides:\n   You probably use the same password for lots of stuff right?\n  Some sites you access such as your Bank or work VPN probably have pretty decent security, so I’m not going to attack them.\n  However, other sites like the Hallmark e-mail greeting cards site, an online forum you frequent, or an e-commerce site you’ve shopped at might not be as well prepared. So those are the ones I’d work on.\n  So, all we have to do now is unleash Brutus, wwwhack, or THC Hydra on their server with instructions to try say 10,000 (or 100,000 – whatever makes you happy) different usernames and passwords as fast as possible.\n  Once we’ve got several login+password pairings we can then go back and test them on targeted sites.\n  But wait… How do I know which bank you use and what your login ID is for the sites you frequent? All those cookies are simply stored, unencrypted and nicely named, in your Web browser’s cache.\n   Any moderately-determined person could figure out how to hack passwords.\n  Normally, when you sign-up for a service, they don’t actually store your password. Instead they store a one-way hash of your password. What does this mean?\n Real password: monkeyfarts Hashed password (SHA–1): a05727a789efdeaaa0b3f45e7f944c1f17691da6.  This way, they don’t know your password (yay, security!), and since it’s a one-way hash, they can’t figure out your real password if all they have is the hashed password.\nBut here’s the problem: If someone were to get a giant list of hashed passwords, there are enough pieces of the puzzle there to be able to begin figuring out common password patterns.\nThis is what happened in 2009 when a site called RockYou got hacked and a giant (32.6 million) list of usernames and hashed passwords were stolen. (RockYou makes fun little things for Facebook, and used to make fun things for MySpace. There’s a very good chance that you’ve used something they’ve done.)\nIn Brief Analysis of RockYou Passwords, we learn:\n   Dictionary passwords, that is, words like “password,” “monkey,” and so on, make one of the most stable groups.\n  Digital passwords based on easily memorized numeric combinations, phone numbers, document numbers, birth dates, and more make another group, which is as stable as the previous one, and maybe even more popular.\n  Passwords based on names and their derivatives. For example, a user may use the name of himself, his pet, some city, some place, and so on.\n  Passwords based on keyboard combinations, such as “abc123,” “qwerty,” etc.\n  Emotional passwords, such as “iloveyou,” “hateu,” “lovely,” “ihatemyboss,” or “ILoveJohn.”\n  […]\nCuriously enough, some users choose obscenely long passwords consisting of more than 20 characters, word combinations, or phrases. Here are some of these wonderful passwords (did you really think that nobody knows what you are typing?):\n  Hahaithinkilovejessebutthenagainmaybenotcuzheisadiknob\n  Lets you come back for your Countdown Timer\n  me plus food equals more sleep each night\n  tommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n  truongcaodangcongdonghaiphong\n  icantbelievethisshit.12345\n  banditbanditbandit1bandit1bandit1banditbandit\n  11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111\n  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n  FUCKSCHOOLANDALLTHETEACHERSINIT\n  ilovepalmermyfuturehusband\n  1delightyourselfinthelord!\n  Imaprincessbecausemyfatheristheking\n  iluvanjabisset4evashesmawebaexxx\n  stuartandchrisrmybestmatesforeva\n  thisismypasswordyoullnevergetit\n   Just for fun, I downloaded a copy of hashcat and the rockyou.txt list of hashed passwords. Within 30 minutes, I’d managed to crack several thousand passwords from the list.\nThis is not hard to do.\nOkay, okay. What should I do differently? First of all, if you’re using password as your password, you’re fired.\n    Don’t use a word that can be found in the dictionary.\n  If you choose to use a word, replace some of the letters with numbers or special characters. (Instead of monkeyfarts, use m0ñKeyƒår†s.)\n  The longer the password, the better. Most sites require a minimum of 6 characters. I’d say to use a minimum of 10 characters. (Most of mine are in the 24–32 character range.)\n  Don’t use the same password twice. I know this may seem hard, but let’s get to the next bullet-point.\n  Stop trying to memorize your passwords. Let a password manager do it for you. 1Password, LastPass and Password Safe are all good solutions.\n  Enhance your passwords with a second level of security. If a service you use supports Two-Factor Authentication (or Multi-Factor Authentication), enable it. This way, even if your password gets hacked, they won’t be able to access your account without a special code that only you have.\n Lots of services are adding support: App.net, Apple, Amazon Web Services, Dreamhost, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, GoDaddy, Google, Microsoft (including Hotmail, MSN \u0026amp; Xbox Live), Paypal, Stripe.com, Yahoo!, WordPress.com (including Gravatar), and more!    If you’re worried about someone (perhaps someone you know) figuring out your password and using it for nefarious purposes (including simply violating your personal privacy, e.g., checking your messages, reading your emails), I would highly recommend doing all 6 things on this list.\nGot it. What else can I do? Lots and lots. Siraj Datoo published a really good list on Quartz called The complete guide to not being that idiot who got the company hacked. This list is good for the home as well. I would encourage you to read the whole post, but here are the bullet points:\n  Install HTTPS Everywhere in your browser. (Switches to secured HTTPS traffic for several popular sites, among other things.)\n  Put a password on your home Wi-Fi. (Also: Use the WPA2 security mode.)\n  Put passwords on all your devices. (Quit butt-dialing me like my friend Lindsey.)\n  Employ two-step authentication on everything. (We already covered this.)\n  Encrypt your laptop’s hard drive, especially if it’s a Mac. (It’s really easy on a Mac. System Preferences → Security → FileVault.)\n  Never send or save your password electronically. (Email, IMs and other forms of electronic communication leave a trail. Don’t be the weakest link.)\n  Use 1Password or a similar service. (We already covered this.)\n  Read your emails carefully to avoid phishing attempts.\n  Take precautions when you use an open Wi-Fi network. (Anybody can connect to an open network and listen for unsecured web traffic to figure out your secrets. This is a very easy thing to do.)\n  Know which applications are connecting to the Internet. (If you have a Mac, Little Snitch is a worthwhile investment.)\n  ",
        "source":"\n{{\u003c description \u003e}}\nMy friend Michelle recently explained to me that \u003cem\u003epassword\u003c/em\u003e is a perfectly valid password to use. Her reason? “People always say not to use it. So now that nobody uses it anymore, it’s totally secure again!”\n{{\u003c /description \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/waahht.png\"\u003e}}\n\n## How I’d Hack Your Weak Passwords\n\nIn this case, Michelle made a fatal assumption. She assumed that human beings would be *manually* typing in guessed passwords. What she failed to understand is that it’s really, really easy for any off-the-shelf computer to chew through possible passwords at an incredible pace.\n\nYou know where they start? With *password*.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/password-trends@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nIn an article written for Lifehacker entitled [How I’d Hack Your Weak Passwords]({{% wayback \"http://lifehacker.com/5505400/how-id-hack-your-weak-passwords\" %}}), author John Pozadzides says the following:\n\n\u003e If you invited me to try and crack your password, you know the one that you use over and over for like every web page you visit, how many guesses would it take before I got it?\n\u003e\n\u003e Let’s see… here is my top 10 list. I can obtain most of this information much easier than you think, then I might just be able to get into your e-mail, computer, or online banking. After all, if I get into one I’ll probably get into all of them.\n\u003e\n\u003e Your partner, child, or pet’s name, possibly followed by a 0 or 1 (because they’re always making you use a number, aren’t they?)\n\u003e\n\u003e 1. The last 4 digits of your social security number.\n\u003e 2. 123 or 1234 or 123456.\n\u003e 3. “password”\n\u003e 4. Your city, or college, football team name.\n\u003e 5. Date of birth – yours, your partner’s or your child’s.\n\u003e 6. “god”\n\u003e 7. “letmein”\n\u003e 8. “money”\n\u003e 9. “love”\n\u003e\n\u003e Statistically speaking that should probably cover about 20% of you. But don’t worry. If I didn’t get it yet it will probably only take a few more minutes before I do…\n\n## Everything you know (about passwords) is wrong\n\nMichelle and I share a cell phone plan. The other day, she asked me for the account info so that she could login and do some stuff. So I gave her my information (because I trust her).\n\n* Username: `my.email@address.com`\n* Password: `cVWXDD$XkA25eZo437F£$^Xp` (not my real password)\n\nShe flipped-out on me. “Who’s going to try to hack into your AT\u0026T account?!” I tried to explain how that wasn’t the point, but she’d already moved on to the next shiny object.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/breached@2x.png\"\u003e}}\n\nI talked a couple of months ago about how I’d [changed every single password I have](/2013/08/10/breaking-my-bad-password-habits-with-1password-authy-oauth-openid/). Why? Because I was re-using the same passwords all over the place, and it was time to fix that.\n\n\u003e In short, one of my hard-to-guess-but-used-in-lots-of-places passwords was one of the ones that was obtained by hackers. As such, I had the fine work ahead of me to change the password for every single site that used the password that got hacked.\n\u003e\n\u003e 1Password to the rescue! It took me about 90 minutes, but I was able to lookup all of the sites where this password was being used, and change the password for all of them.

They were usually a blend of 8 alphanumeric and/or symbol characters. Nothing too wild, but after a while, I established some muscle memory around typing them and began to rely on them. This is a better approach than most people use, but it’s still a terrible practice. Over time, I began appending special characters here, or prepending them there. Sometimes I would stick a dollar sign or two somewhere in the middle to mix things up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"enter-1password\"\u003eEnter 1Password\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/1password@2x.png\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen in 2008, I discovered a piece of software called \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090348/https://agilebits.com/onepassword\"\u003e1Password\u003c/a\u003e.

But I sucked it up, bought a license, and started using it regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the single best investment I’ve ever made. Software-wise, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"openid-and-oauth\"\u003eOpenID and OAuth\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/oauth@2x.png\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround the same time as when I discovered 1Password, I also learned about something called \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090348/http://openid.net\"\u003eOpenID\u003c/a\u003e. The approach that OpenID takes is known as \u003cem\u003eFederated Identity\u003c/em\u003e. It’s essentially a system where two people don’t know or trust each other, but they both trust a third person, and that third person vouches for each of the first two. Eric and Jeff don’t know each other, but they both know me. I vouch for Jeff with Eric saying that he’s a cool dude, and vice-versa. Make sense?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt allowed me to trust a company of my choosing to vouch for me, whenever I came to log into sites which supported OpenID. If something happened and I didn’t trust that middle company any more, I could simply change the company/service which vouched for me. In that way, I only had to remember the username and password for that one company that was vouching for me, instead of having to create all-new accounts for every service I signed-up for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were some quirks that made OpenID a bit harder to understand for normal folks, so the great minds of the Internet got together and bore a different system known as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130810090348/http://oauth.net\"\u003eOAuth\u003c/a\u003e. You know all of those sites you visit that have a big blue button that says “Login with Facebook”? That’s OAuth in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOAuth works a bit differently behind the scenes. You say, “I want to sign up for your site”. The website says, \u0026ldquo;Either give me your information so I can register you, or you can \u003cem\u003eauthorize\u003c/em\u003e me to get your information from someone else who already has it.\u0026rdquo; And you respond with, “Sure. Facebook has it.” You then click the blue button, tell Facebook that you authorize the new site to pull your information, and away you go. Between the two approaches, OAuth is used about a zillion times more often than OpenID is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would recommend using OpenID or OAuth for handling your login information if at all possible because it reduces the number of passwords you need to keep track of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"sonys-playstation-network-got-hacked\"\u003eSony’s Playstation Network got hacked\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember when this happened?

        "plain":"I learned at a relatively young age what makes a good password versus a bad password, and I’ve tried to always use these qualities in the passwords that I choose.   The Problem Unfortunately, even with the best intentions, you inevitably end up re-using one or a few passwords across every single website you log into. Some people do things as dumb as using the name of their significant other. Or their pet. Or a birthdate. Or something else equally guessable by one of the many supercomputers that exist (whereby “supercomputer”, I mean pretty much any computer invented in the past 5–7 years).\nMy approach was this: Whenever a website would auto-generate a random password for me, instead of changing it to something I could remember, I simply memorized it. They were usually a blend of 8 alphanumeric and/or symbol characters. Nothing too wild, but after a while, I established some muscle memory around typing them and began to rely on them. This is a better approach than most people use, but it’s still a terrible practice. Over time, I began appending special characters here, or prepending them there. Sometimes I would stick a dollar sign or two somewhere in the middle to mix things up.\nEnter 1Password   Then in 2008, I discovered a piece of software called 1Password. Initially I balked at the price. \u0026ldquo;You want me to pay for software?!\u0026rdquo; Clearly I was still in a Windows-user’s state of mind when it came to things like that. But I sucked it up, bought a license, and started using it regularly.\nIt is the single best investment I’ve ever made. Software-wise, anyway.\nOpenID and OAuth   Around the same time as when I discovered 1Password, I also learned about something called OpenID. The approach that OpenID takes is known as Federated Identity. It’s essentially a system where two people don’t know or trust each other, but they both trust a third person, and that third person vouches for each of the first two. Eric and Jeff don’t know each other, but they both know me. I vouch for Jeff with Eric saying that he’s a cool dude, and vice-versa. Make sense?\nIt allowed me to trust a company of my choosing to vouch for me, whenever I came to log into sites which supported OpenID. If something happened and I didn’t trust that middle company any more, I could simply change the company/service which vouched for me. In that way, I only had to remember the username and password for that one company that was vouching for me, instead of having to create all-new accounts for every service I signed-up for.\nBut there were some quirks that made OpenID a bit harder to understand for normal folks, so the great minds of the Internet got together and bore a different system known as OAuth. You know all of those sites you visit that have a big blue button that says “Login with Facebook”? That’s OAuth in action.\nOAuth works a bit differently behind the scenes. You say, “I want to sign up for your site”. The website says, \u0026ldquo;Either give me your information so I can register you, or you can authorize me to get your information from someone else who already has it.\u0026rdquo; And you respond with, “Sure. Facebook has it.” You then click the blue button, tell Facebook that you authorize the new site to pull your information, and away you go. Between the two approaches, OAuth is used about a zillion times more often than OpenID is.\nI would recommend using OpenID or OAuth for handling your login information if at all possible because it reduces the number of passwords you need to keep track of.\nSony’s Playstation Network got hacked Remember when this happened? Where Sony was storing passwords in m********king plain text?! (To paraphrase Shepherd Book from Firefly/Serenity, there is a special place in Hell for people who rape, murder, talk during movies, and store passwords in plain text.)\n  In short, one of my hard-to-guess-but-used-in-lots-of-places passwords was one of the ones that was obtained by hackers. As such, I had the fine work ahead of me to change the password for every single site that used the password that got hacked.\n1Password to the rescue! It took me about 90 minutes, but I was able to lookup all of the sites where this password was being used, and change the password for all of them.

You can even install the Authy plugin in your self-hosted WordPress installation to enable extra security for your blog. I would absolutely recommend enabling 2-Factor Authentication (using Authy, of course) for every single service you use that supports it.\nChanging every password   2 days ago, I decided to bite the bullet and put in the work to change every single password I had stored in 1Password (around 250).

        "plain":"I didn’t know Aaron personally, so there’s no insight I can provide into the person who I’ve read people describe as “a brilliant soul”.\n  The world is now a worse place The tech world is abuzz with the news that, at only 26 years old, Aaron Swartz decided to take his own life. I heard about it last night when I opened up Tweetbot, and saw two tweets back-to-back in my timeline:\n@al3x :\n We lost @aaronsw. — Alex Payne (@al3x) January 12, 2013.\n @dcurtis :\n Fuck. tech.mit.edu/V132/N61/swart…The world is now a worse place. — dustin curtis (@dcurtis) January 12, 2013.\n RSS Being part of the web world, I certainly knew Aaron by reputation. I first heard about him back when I started tinkering with RSS in 2003. While I may have started a project that simplified RSS for a legion of PHP developers, Aaron literally wrote the spec — and at 14 years old, I might add.\nCory Doctorow had this to say:\n I met Aaron when he was 14 or 15. He was working on XML stuff (he co-wrote the RSS specification when he was 14) and came to San Francisco often, and would stay with Lisa Rein , a friend of mine who was also an XML person and who took care of him and assured his parents he had adult supervision. In so many ways, he was an adult, even then, with a kind of intense, fast intellect that really made me feel like he was part and parcel of the Internet society, like he belonged in the place where your thoughts are what matter, and not who you are or how old you are.\n Creative Commons. PACER. Demand Progress.   Every so often throughout the last decade, his name would pop-up around topics that I was also interested in. Creative Commons. Opening up public access to court records. Demand Progress. He used technology to fight for the same sorts of causes that I fight for, evangelize for, or are otherwise close to my heart. Namely:\n  the over-criminalization of American citizens by its government, and…\n  the fact that the people we elect to represent us in government would throw us under the bus in a heartbeat if it meant more money, power and political cachet.\n  Cory Doctorow continues:\n At one point, he singlehandedly liberated 20 percent of US law. PACER, the system that gives Americans access to their own (public domain) case-law, charged a fee for each such access. After activists built RECAP (which allowed its users to put any caselaw they paid for into a free/public repository), Aaron spent a small fortune fetching a titanic amount of data and putting it into the public domain. The feds hated this. They smeared him, the FBI investigated him, and for a while, it looked like he’d be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff, but he escaped it all, and emerged triumphant.\n Aaron was involved in the creation of an organization called Demand Progress, who “works to win progressive policy changes for ordinary people through organizing, and grassroots lobbying. In particular, we tend to focus on issues of civil liberties, civil rights, and government reform.”\nIt was here where I first learned about the Senate’s proposed PROTECT-IP Act (later renamed “PIPA”), and it’s House sibling, the ill-fated SOPA Act, whose negative repercussions would have been felt for generations to come.\nDownload too much, go to jail From a New York Times article dated July 19, 2011:\n Demand Progress said on its site that it appeared Mr. Swartz was “being charged with allegedly downloading too many scholarly journal articles from the Web.” It quoted the group’s executive director, David Segal, as saying, “It’s like trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.”\n Cory Doctorow:\n Aaron snuck into MIT and planted a laptop in a utility closet, used it to download a lot of journal articles (many in the public domain), and then snuck in and retrieved it. This sort of thing is pretty par for the course around MIT, and though Aaron wasn’t an MIT student, he was a fixture in the Cambridge hacker scene, and associated with Harvard, and generally part of that gang, and Aaron hadn’t done anything with the articles (yet), so it seemed likely that it would just fizzle out. Instead, they threw the book at him. Even though MIT and JSTOR (the journal publisher) backed down, the prosecution kept on. I heard lots of theories: the feds who’d tried unsuccessfully to nail him for the PACER/RECAP stunt had a serious hate-on for him; the feds were chasing down all the Cambridge hackers who had any connection to Bradley Manning in the hopes of turning one of them, and other, less credible theories. A couple of lawyers close to the case told me that they thought Aaron would go to jail.\n And Larry Lessig:\n But all this shows is that if the government proved its case, some punishment was appropriate. So what was that appropriate punishment? Was Aaron a terrorist? Or a cracker trying to profit from stolen goods? Or was this something completely different? Early on, and to its great credit, JSTOR figured “appropriate” out: They declined to pursue their own action against Aaron, and they asked the government to drop its. MIT, to its great shame, was not as clear, and so the prosecutor had the excuse he needed to continue his war against the “criminal” who we who loved him knew as Aaron.\n And an article from September by Tim Cushing from TechDirt:\n Swartz, the executive director of Demand Progress, was charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a catch-all designation for “computer activity the US government doesn’t like.” Swartz had accessed MIT’s computer network to download a large number of files from JSTOR, a non-profit that hosts academic journal articles. US prosecutors claimed he “stole” several thousand files, but considering MIT offered this access for free on campus (and the files being digital), it’s pretty tough to square his massive downloading with any idea of “theft.”\n Prosecutor as bully   Larry Lessig continues (reformatted paragraphs, mine):\n Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior.\nFrom the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of ACADEMIC ARTICLES is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.\nAaron had literally done nothing in his life “to make money.” He was fortunate Reddit turned out as it did, but from his work building the RSS standard, to his work architecting Creative Commons, to his work liberating public records, to his work building a free public library, to his work supporting Change Congress/FixCongressFirst/Rootstrikers, and then Demand Progress, Aaron was always and only working for (at least his conception of) the public good. He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?\nThat person is gone today, driven to the edge by what a decent society would only call bullying. I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government [against] you. For remember, we live in a world where the architects of the financial crisis regularly dine at the White House — and where even those brought to “justice” never even have to admit any wrongdoing, let alone be labeled “felons.”\n And again from TechDirt:\n There are now 13 felony counts in the new indictment, derived from claims of multiple instances of breaking those four laws. In specific:\n Wire Fraud - 2 counts Computer Fraud - 5 counts Unlawfully Obtaining Information from a Protected Computer - 5 counts Recklessly Damaging a Protected Computer - 1 count  It’s beyond my pay grade to figure out how many years in prison that all could be, when taking into account the complexities of sentencing law. Let’s leave it at a large scary number. Enough to ruin someone’s life.\n And the kicker…\n So, how do the new charges stack up in terms of a sentence? Tough to say.

He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more.\n From the post \u0026ldquo;My Aaron Swartz, whom I loved.,\u0026rdquo; by Quinn Norton:\n He loved my daughter so much it filled the room like a mist. He was transported playing with her, and she bored right into his heart. In his darkest moments, which I couldn’t reach him, Ada could still touch him, even if only for a moment. And when he was in the light, my god. I couldn’t keep up with either of them. I would hang back and watch them spring and play and laugh, and be so grateful for them both.\n Expert witness Alex Stamos, in \u0026ldquo;The Truth about Aaron Swartz’s ‘Crime’\u0026quot;:\n In short, Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not pose a real danger to JSTOR, MIT or the public. He was an intelligent young man who found a loophole that would allow him to download a lot of documents quickly. This loophole was created intentionally by MIT and JSTOR, and was codified contractually in the piles of paperwork turned over during discovery.\nIf I had taken the stand as planned and had been asked by the prosecutor whether Aaron’s actions were “wrong”, I would probably have replied that what Aaron did would better be described as “inconsiderate”. In the same way it is inconsiderate to write a check at the supermarket while a dozen people queue up behind you or to check out every book at the library needed for a History 101 paper. It is inconsiderate to download lots of files on shared wifi or to spider Wikipedia too quickly, but none of these actions should lead to a young person being hounded for years and haunted by the possibility of a 35 year sentence.\n Update (2013–01–20) I’ve continued to add to the links below as I’ve come across them, but a few more interesting things are beginning to shake-out from Aaron’s prosecution.\nScott Horton from Harper’s Magazine writes (Emphasis mine):\n U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz is fighting to hold on to her job, and to avoid an embarrassing grilling in Congress and possible professional disciplinary proceedings. Her prospects look grim. Rep. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.), chair of the House Committee on Oversight is pledging a vigorous and critical inquiry into her management of the dubious criminal prosecution of Aaron Swartz, one of the greatest computer prodigies of his generation, who committed suicide a week ago, apparently convinced that out-of-control prosecutors had destroyed his life. […]\nAt funeral services in Highland Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, Swartz’s father charged that his son had been “killed by the government.” While some might ascribe this to the anguish of a bereaved father, scholars and investigators poring over the record of the Swartz prosecution are increasingly shocked at the scope and outrageousness of the prosecutorial misconduct that he faced. […]\nAlthough each of these counts bordered on the preposterous, Ortiz and Heymann clearly reckoned that at least one or two would stick during the jury-room bargaining process. More to the point, they assumed that the risk of their success even on bogus charges would be enough to pressure Swartz into accepting a guilty plea on all the counts in exchange for a reduced sentence — which is what they offered him. The process was fundamentally corrupt and shameful. But observers of the American criminal-justice system also know that it was a common one.\n I first learned about this corrupt little trick, long-since leveraged by federal prosecutors, when my best-friend-since-childhood made a stupid mistake one evening that was technically a felony offense — he viewed a 30-second video clip of somebody else committing a felony.\nThis is the same thing that police do when they’re investigating a bank robbery. The same thing that news anchors do when they show a security tape of people smashing through the front-doors of an Apple Store to steal iPads, “more at eleven”. Had he walked by and seen it happening through a window, he wouldn’t have been prosecuted. But he saw a half-minute recording and they threw the book at him. It’s very much like how prostitution is illegal, but if you record the act, suddenly it becomes porn. Perfectly legal.\n50 hours of community service would have been plenty to correct the mistake he made and make him pay more attention to his actions in the future. Instead, trumped-up charges by federal prosecutors resulted in him being sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary, followed by 5 years under probation, and another 15–20 years on the Sex Offender Registry living as a social pariah.\n(Studies by the U.S. Justice Department and other organizations show that recidivism rates are significantly lower for convicted sex offenders than for burglars, robbers, thieves, drug offenders and other convicts.)\nHe lost his home, his career, many of his friends, and because of his registry status he can’t find work — all because he made a stupid mistake. He’s doing everything he possibly can to re-assimilate back into society, but society doesn’t want him. His life was ruined. Fortunately, he’s smart, well-spoken and a hard worker. He was able to start two companies and is able to provide for his wife and 3 children. One of those companies is dedicated to helping people who were likewise abused by the federal justice system and have experienced the injustice of the Bureau of Prisons.\nBut I digress…\nTimothy B. Lee, from Ars Technica, follows-up on Aaron’s Law:\n On Tuesday, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) took to the pages of reddit to introduce legislation she dubbed “Aaron’s Law.” Lofgren’s bill would modify the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the basis for Swartz’s prosecution, to clarify that its definition of unauthorized access “does not include access in violation of an agreement or contractual obligation, such as an acceptable use policy or terms of service agreement, with an Internet service provider, Internet website, or employer.” It would make a similar change to the wire fraud statute.\nThe language was praised by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig, a friend of Swartz whose wife organized his legal defense fund. “This is a CRITICALLY important change that would do incredible good,” Lessig wrote on reddit. “The CFAA was the hook for the government’s bullying of @aaronsw. This law would remove that hook.”\n More links…  A Chat with Aaron Swartz (Blogoscoped) Raw Thought: The Weblog of Aaron Swartz in Markdown, PDF, and ePub (GitHub) Carmen Ortiz Strikes Out (Harper’s) Still More About The Death Of Aaron Swartz (Esquire) How the Legal System Failed Aaron Swartz (The New Yorker) Darrell Issa Probing Prosecution Of Aaron Swartz, Internet Pioneer Who Killed Himself (Huffington Post) Lawmakers slam DOJ prosecution of Swartz as ‘ridiculous, absurd’ (The Hill) Did Prosecutors Go Too Far In Swartz Case?

I heard about it last night when I opened up Tweetbot, and saw two tweets back-to-back in my timeline:\n\n{{\u003c twitter al3x \u003e}}:\n\n\u003e We lost @[aaronsw]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/aaronsw\" %}}). — {{\u003c person name=\"Alex Payne\" url=\"https://twitter.com/al3x\" \u003e}} (@al3x) [January 12, 2013]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/al3x/status/290008536241565696\" %}}).\n\n{{\u003c twitter dcurtis \u003e}}:\n\n\u003e Fuck.

I first heard about him back when I started tinkering with RSS in 2003. While I [may have started a project that simplified RSS for a legion of PHP developers]({{% wayback \"http://simplepie.org\" %}}), Aaron literally wrote the spec — and at 14 years old, I might add.\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Cory Doctorow\" \u003e}} [had this to say]({{% wayback \"http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e I met Aaron when he was 14 or 15. He was working on XML stuff (he co-wrote the RSS specification when he was 14) and came to San Francisco often, and would stay with {{\u003c person name=\"Lisa Rein\" \u003e}}, a friend of mine who was also an XML person and who took care of him and assured his parents he had adult supervision. In so many ways, he was an adult, even then, with a kind of intense, fast intellect that really made me feel like he was part and parcel of the Internet society, like he belonged in the place where your thoughts are what matter, and not who you are or how old you are.\n\n## Creative Commons. PACER. Demand Progress.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/demand-progress@2x.png\"\u003e}}\n\nEvery so often throughout the last decade, his name would pop-up around topics that I was also interested in. [Creative Commons]({{% wayback \"http://creativecommons.org\" %}}). Opening up [public access to court records]({{% wayback \"https://www.recapthelaw.org\" %}}). [Demand Progress]({{% wayback \"http://demandprogress.org\" %}}). He used technology to fight for the same sorts of causes that I fight for, evangelize for, or are otherwise close to my heart. *Namely:*\n\n* the over-criminalization of American citizens by its government, and…\n\n* the fact that the people we elect to represent us in government would throw us under the bus in a heartbeat if it meant more money, power and political cachet.\n\nCory Doctorow continues:\n\n\u003e At one point, he singlehandedly liberated 20 percent of US law. PACER, the system that gives Americans access to their own (public domain) case-law, charged a fee for each such access. After activists built RECAP (which allowed its users to put any caselaw they paid for into a free/public repository), Aaron spent a small fortune fetching a titanic amount of data and putting it into the public domain. The feds hated this. They smeared him, the FBI investigated him, and for a while, it looked like he’d be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff, but he escaped it all, and emerged triumphant.\n\nAaron was involved in the creation of an organization called [Demand Progress]({{% wayback \"http://demandprogress.org\" %}}), who *“works to win progressive policy changes for ordinary people through organizing, and grassroots lobbying. In particular, we tend to focus on issues of civil liberties, civil rights, and government reform.”*\n\nIt was here where I first learned about the Senate’s proposed [PROTECT-IP Act]({{% wayback \"http://www.fightforthefuture.org/pipa/\" %}}) (later renamed “PIPA”), and it’s House sibling, the ill-fated [SOPA Act]({{% wayback \"http://sopastrike.com\" %}}), whose negative repercussions would have been felt for *generations* to come.\n\n## Download too much, go to jail\n\nFrom a [New York Times article dated July 19, 2011]({{% wayback \"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/reddit-co-founder-charged-with-data-theft/?pagewanted=all\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Demand Progress said on its site that it appeared Mr. Swartz was “being charged with allegedly downloading too many scholarly journal articles from the Web.” It quoted the group’s executive director, David Segal, as saying, “It’s like trying to put someone in jail for allegedly checking too many books out of the library.”\n\nCory Doctorow:\n\n\u003e Aaron snuck into MIT and planted a laptop in a utility closet, used it to download a lot of journal articles (many in the public domain), and then snuck in and retrieved it. This sort of thing is pretty par for the course around MIT, and though Aaron wasn’t an MIT student, he was a fixture in the Cambridge hacker scene, and associated with Harvard, and generally part of that gang, and Aaron hadn’t done anything with the articles (yet), so it seemed likely that it would just fizzle out. Instead, they threw the book at him. Even though MIT and JSTOR (the journal publisher) backed down, the prosecution kept on. I heard lots of theories: the feds who’d tried unsuccessfully to nail him for the PACER/RECAP stunt had a serious hate-on for him; the feds were chasing down all the Cambridge hackers who had any connection to Bradley Manning in the hopes of turning one of them, and other, less credible theories. A couple of lawyers close to the case told me that they thought Aaron would go to jail.\n\nAnd [Larry Lessig]({{% wayback \"http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully\" %}}):\n\n\u003e But all this shows is that if the government proved its case, some punishment was appropriate. So what was that appropriate punishment? Was Aaron a terrorist? Or a cracker trying to profit from stolen goods? Or was this something completely different? Early on, and to its great credit, JSTOR figured “appropriate” out: They declined to pursue their own action against Aaron, and they asked the government to drop its. MIT, to its great shame, was not as clear, and so the prosecutor had the excuse he needed to continue his war against the “criminal” who we who loved him knew as Aaron.\n\nAnd an [article from September]({{% wayback \"http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120917/17393320412/us-government-ups-felony-count-jstoraaron-swartz-case-four-to-thirteen.shtml\" %}}) by Tim Cushing from TechDirt:\n\n\u003e Swartz, the executive director of Demand Progress, was charged with violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, a catch-all designation for “computer activity the US government doesn’t like.” Swartz had accessed MIT’s computer network to download a large number of files from JSTOR, a non-profit that hosts academic journal articles. US prosecutors claimed he “stole” several thousand files, but considering MIT offered this access for free on campus (and the files being digital), it’s pretty tough to square his massive downloading with any idea of “theft.”\n\n## Prosecutor as bully\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2013/aaron-swartz2.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Larry Lessig\" \u003e}} continues (reformatted paragraphs, mine):\n\n\u003e Here is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior.\n\u003e\n\u003e From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of *ACADEMIC ARTICLES* is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.\n\u003e\n\u003e Aaron had literally done nothing in his life “to make money.” He was fortunate Reddit turned out as it did, but from his work building the RSS standard, to his work architecting Creative Commons, to his work liberating public records, to his work building a free public library, to his work supporting Change Congress/FixCongressFirst/Rootstrikers, and then Demand Progress, Aaron was always and only working for (at least his conception of) the public good. He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?\n\u003e\n\u003e That person is gone today, driven to the edge by what a decent society would only call bullying. I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government \\[against\\] you. For remember, we live in a world where the architects of the financial crisis regularly dine at the White House — and where even those brought to “justice” never even have to admit any wrongdoing, let alone be labeled “felons.”\n\nAnd again from TechDirt:\n\n\u003e There are now 13 felony counts in the new indictment, derived from claims of multiple instances of breaking those four laws. In specific:\n\u003e\n\u003e * Wire Fraud - 2 counts\n\u003e * Computer Fraud - 5 counts\n\u003e * Unlawfully Obtaining Information from a Protected Computer - 5 counts\n\u003e * Recklessly Damaging a Protected Computer - 1 count\n\u003e\n\u003e It’s beyond my pay grade to figure out how many years in prison that all could be, when taking into account the complexities of sentencing law. Let’s leave it at a large scary number. Enough to ruin someone’s life.\n\nAnd the kicker…\n\n\u003e So, how do the new charges stack up in terms of a sentence? Tough to say. Each of the charges carries the possibility of a fine and imprisonment of up to 10–20 years per felony. Depending on how many of the counts Swartz is found guilty of, the sentence could conceivably total 50+ years and fine in the area of $4 million. All this over publicly accessed research documents that JSTOR doesn’t even feel the need to pursue further than it did.\n\n## In the end\n\n{{\u003c person name=\"Alan Ellis\" \u003e}}, a nationally-recognized federal criminal defense lawyer [explains]({{% wayback \"http://www.alanellis.com\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Nearly 97 percent of all federal criminal defendants will plead guilty.

Instead, trumped-up charges by federal prosecutors resulted in him being sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary, followed by 5 years under probation, and another 15–20 years on the Sex Offender Registry living as a social pariah.\n\n(Studies by the U.S. Justice Department and other organizations show that [recidivism rates are significantly lower for convicted sex offenders than for burglars, robbers, thieves, drug offenders and other convicts]({{% wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/opinion/sunday/sex-offenders-the-last-pariahs.html?pagewanted=all\u0026_r=0\" %}}).)\n\nHe lost his home, his career, many of his friends, and because of his registry status he can’t find work — all because he made a stupid mistake. He’s doing everything he possibly can to re-assimilate back into society, but society doesn’t want him. His life was ruined. Fortunately, he’s smart, well-spoken and a hard worker.

        "plain":"A recent editorial on Business Insider layer out a number of reasons why the author, Ed Conway, was “leaving Apple”. This is my response.\nSelf-Indulgent Weiner In his editorial, Ed Conway wrote:\n Dear Tim,\nThere’s no easy way to put this so I’ll just come right out with it. I’m leaving you. It’s been great (mostly) but it’s over.\nI figured the least I could do is to explain my decision in full – I like to think it might help protect you from nasty break-ups like this in the future.\n I can’t help but think of the “self-indulgent weiner” line delivered by Nicholas Cage as Memphis Raines in the movie Gone in Sixty Seconds.\nEd, you’re going to complain in an effort to get page views. You’re trolling the Apple/anti-Apple crowds to get attention. That, sir, makes you a whore.\nLong-time Apple user  I’ve been with you, with Apple I mean, for 13 years now – ever since 1999. Perhaps you’ve forgotten: I was a spotty teenager; I bought one of your cute little translucent iBooks. Slowly but surely I painted most parts of my technological life a bright shade of Apple. Let’s see: I’ve owned two iMacs, a number of iBooks, countless Macbooks (I’ve currently got two on the go, for some unknown reason), an iPhone for almost five years, an iPad since the very beginning; iPods, iPod touches, iPod nanos – I’ve had ‘em all. I even invested in an Apple TV and, wait for it, a G4 Power Mac Cube (yes, that was me!).\n So, you’ve been an Apple user for a long time. That’s awesome. It’s made your life better, hasn’t it?\n I’ll admit I became dependent on you – clingy, even. When I went to the States a couple of years back I shelled out hundreds of dollars to ensure I wouldn’t be without an iPhone – even though I was back at college and wasn’t exactly rolling in it. And like so many of those who fall in love with you, soon enough I found myself working part-time as your best PR spokesman: I spent hours persuading all my friends to buy your stuff. I even wrote a blog about what made Apple such a dynamic, innovative and successful company.\n Blog post. You wrote a blog post, you idiot. A “blog” is a collection of posts, not a single one. You don’t “write a blog”, you \u0026ldquo;write a blog post\u0026rdquo;.\nBut that’s neither here nor there. It simply gives me a baseline of your intelligence so that I know whether I can gear my language and logic up or down. Clearly, it’s down.\nThe hype  Like millions of others, I really believed the hype.\n Yes, because Apple’s success has been built on hype, and hype alone. (If you believe this, then I have some ocean-front property in Arizona to sell you.)\nApple builds some of the fastest, thinnest and lightest computers with incredibly high build quality. The ones with some of the best displays (in terms of resolution (2880x1800), pixel density (326ppi) and color accuracy), best resale value, and have the highest consumer rating. They’re #1 in U.S. unit share for notebooks (Mac) (née laptops), and #1 in worldwide unit share for tablets (iPads).\nThe’ve created not one, but two of the most user-friendly consumer operating systems on the market. They redefined not only one, not even two, but three separate industries. And all of their devices work seamlessly together to create a really fantastic experience.\nBut no, it’s just hype.\nMore uninformed stupidity  I never thought I would utter these words, but here goes: I’m leaving you. I have already traded in my iPhone for a Samsung.\n A Samsung. One whole Samsung. *facepalm*\n Now, I know you don’t like lists (at least I presume that’s why you avoided including a task application in Mac OS and iOS for so many years) but it’s only right that I run through the issues:\n There has been a task manager in Mac OS (classic) as far back as System 1.0, AFAICT. Mac OS X has had a task manager since back in the NeXTStep days (1990’s). iOS didn’t support multitasking until iOS 4 (2010), and even then has chosen not to allow rampant or unchecked multitasking for user experience and battery life reasons. Every single detail about your last paragraph was 100% incorrect.\niOS 6  Yes, I know I’m hardly the first to mention this – but that doesn’t make it any less valid as a complaint. It is truly, truly awful. I’m usually ready to forgive one or two niggles in a new iteration of operating system. After all, they’re usually outweighed by the improvements. In this case, I honestly can’t think of a single new feature that in any way enhances the phone. Every change you’ve made is negative.\n There are zero features of iOS 6 that are positive? So then you must think that every single one of these features is a bad thing.\n  User must confirm access to Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos and Location Data when an app requests them.\n  It’s easy to keep contact information up-to-date with Facebook integration.\n  Asynchronous Game Center integration which allows for fantastic games like Letterpress to exist.\n  Built-in turn-by-turn navigation. 3D flyover views in Maps.\n  Siri has been improved, supports more types of information, and is available on more devices.\n  Facebook and Twitter notifications at the OS-level.\n  Shared photo streams (accessible to everyone, not just Facebook users).\n  The immensely-useful Passbook allows me to start keeping track of gift cards, tickets and other things without having to keep them in my wallet.\n  FaceTime conversations over cellular (3G, 4G and LTE).\n  Faster JavaScript, and improved CSS 3 and HTML 5 support in Safari.\n  The ability to decline calls (regardless of which view you’re in) then send the caller a message instead if you can’t talk right now.\n  Do Not Disturb settings for all of those overnight notifications, texts and drunken phone calls.\n  Automatic syncing of tabs between Safari on Mac/iPhone/iPad over iCloud.\n  Further-improved accessibility settings for people who need them.\n   The maps application is utterly horrendous; you must have known this is among the most commonly-used of all functional parts of a smartphone and that to change it quite so substantially would be seriously disruptive.\n The new Apple-powered (instead of Google-powered) Maps app has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Maps load faster (thanks to vector-based rendering), I get turn-by-turn directions with voiceover for free (this used to cost $50 for a third-party app), and the 3D “flyover” view has allowed me to discover a bunch of cool things in downtown Seattle that I never knew existed.\nThe only “loss” I experienced was transit maps. This forced me to discover a number of transit mapping applications that are way better than what I used to use Google Maps in iOS for. Two apps that I use frequently are OneBusAway and Lumatic City Maps. In a pinch, I can use Google Transit Maps in Safari.\n Take iTunes Match. In the previous iOS I could download any individual song in my iTunes Match library, so I could listen to it overseas without data or when in the Tube. Now your dreadful new operating system will only let me download whole albums […]\n This is partially false. I use iTunes Match all the time. Yes, they’ve removed the one-by-one icons for downloading individual songs. This is a little disappointing, but not super disappointing. I often use playlists (including Smart Playlists) in iTunes, so it’s pretty easy for me to add a song that I want to a playlist, then sync down that playlist.\n […] and then won’t let me delete them afterwards, so my iPhone gets clogged up with stuff before arbitrarily deleting precious chunks of data when it reaches capacity.\n Not true, but deleting songs is more complicated as you need to turn off iTunes Match, then manually delete individual songs one-by-one from the list view.\nThis argument is less moronic than the others… so far.\n As do I find the fact that you now seem to have decided to allow the iOS to decide unilaterally to use the telephone network rather than wifi when it so chooses.\n What? I have no idea what you’re talking about here.\n Given how badly you screwed up with the whole secret GPS-tracking of iPhone users, I’d have thought you realised we don’t like it when you behave creepily like this. It’s seriously not cool, but then more on that later.\n Oh, you mean how the complete opposite of your statement is the truth?\n All the new, exciting apps you’ve brought in are, I’m afraid to say, rubbish.\n Let’s take a look.\n Podcasts: dismal and buggy.\n Yes, Podcasts 1.0 was a terrible app. But we’re no longer talking about iOS 6.\n Facebook integration: should have been there years ago.\n Apple gave you what you wanted, and now you’re complaining.\n Passbook: erm – seriously?\n One of my favorite additions, actually. I use it frequently.\n Siri’s improvements are lost on me because, like most users, the only time I’ve engaged with Siri is to see how many swear words he/she/it understands (answer: a surprising number).\n I’ll now have to take back my not-so-moronic statement about you that I made earlier.\n Finally, for some reason iOS also seems to have broken the tilt-scrolling in Instapaper, which I resent because, well, I just use that app a lot.\n So do I. And it works. Or were you using the iOS 6 Beta which was in, you know, beta status?\nYou’ve lost it  This is going to sound awful, but I can’t think of any big product you’ve re-imagined well since the iPad, and that was almost three years ago.\n Stupidity should be painful. It seems as though Ed believes that if things don’t change radically from one iteration to the next, then they suck. Dude, take your Ritalin and calm your ADHD-ass the **** down.\n iCloud? Not as good as dropbox, and actually more confusing. FaceTime? Slick, but still pales in comparison with Skype. iMessages? Mostly annoying, particularly when it sends messages twice. Siri? See the previous point. Safari? Not as good as Chrome or Firefox. Safari’s Reader function? Not as good as Instapaper. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\n Apple has been doing this for a while, so I’m surprised that Ed — a 13-year Apple veteran — hasn’t been paying attention.\nApple does not try to replace existing apps and functionality. Rather, it seeks to chase them up the bean pole. In other words, Apple comes in to the entry level of the market (informing some people that such a market exists in the first place), and challenges the incumbents to provide mid- and advanced-level features for people who want more.\n  iCloud: Handles your fundamental syncing tasks across devices with zero effort.\n  FaceTime: Always-on. Just tap the contact info of a friend or family member with a Mac, iPhone or iPad, and the call begins. No signing up. No ads. Simple.\n  iMessages: I can send and receive messages to other Mac/iPhone/iPad users from my Mac/iPhone/iPad. Messages sync across all devices so I never have to wonder where they went.\n  Siri: Fantastic. Easy to send text messages to people via voice while I’m driving. Easy to look up turn-by-turn directions. Easy to find a list of nearby Thai restaurants, with user-submitted reviews, ratings and price information.\n  Safari: Safari is incredibly fast on Mac and iOS. It’s become my preferred browser over both Chrome and Firefox because of this.\n  Safari’s Reader function: Most people don’t realize that you can read websites with all of the ads and crap stripped out of them. Instapaper led the charge, but Pocket is also coming along. Safari Reader is an entry-level feature.\n   Plus, my Mac simply doesn’t work that well any more. The contacts on my iPhone don’t seem to sync very well with my laptop. Aperture is extraordinarily slow and buggy, Pages and Numbers are a bit of a nonsense. It just feels like you don’t make the best software anymore. And it doesn’t fit together as seamlessly as in the past.\n SOMETHING IS WRONG! FIX IT! MAKE IT WORK!\nI don’t have any of the technical problems Ed’s talking about (e.g., contact syncing). I like Pages, but I prefer to write in Markdown using iA Writer. I have no need for Numbers. Since all of Ed’s assertions are unqualified and he fails to explain anything, it’s clear that he’s just ranting about things he doesn’t (or hasn’t taken the time to) understand.\nYou’re not cool anymore  Again, this is probably a body blow, but it’s also true. It’s not merely that I now have to put up with your products being used by my mother. The fact is that Apple used to be edgy; it used to be associated with the counterculture; it used to be rebellious. I liked that. I liked the fact that you were uncompromising. […]\n Yes, and Apple also almost went bankrupt in 1996. They were rebels without a clue. Now they’re wildly successful because they chose not to follow in the footsteps of other companies… and you’re mad?\n When you introduced the iMac you ditched the serial ports and insisted everyone had to make do with USB ports, despite the fact there was approximately one printer in the world which worked with USB. You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos. There was something cool about that attitude.\n None… (reading…) yep, none of those things have changed.\n These days, you’re all too ready to compromise. Do you want to know the beginning of the end of our relationship? It was when you decided to include an SD slot in your MacBooks. Why? I can’t imagine the Apple of old ever doing this; there is no inherent reason why you need one in your laptop, save to compromise. And in compromising, you’ve become too complex.\n User research showed that lots and lots of people were using SD cards in their cameras and other devices, so Apple added an SD card reader into their laptops. Apple did what made things simpler for users.\n I remember the first iMac: it was the first computer you didn’t really need an instruction manual for. When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use. That’s the first time I’ve ever had to use an Apple instruction manual.\n You swipe. You tap. If you want to check out the settings, you tap on “Settings”. It’s really not complex. Both my son and my daughter (elementary school age) were able to pick up my iPhone (and later my iPad) and begin using them immediately with zero instruction.\nWhat does that say about you, Ed?\n Apple used to be about purity, which in turn made its products simpler and more reliable; somewhere along the way, this got lost. Or rather, Apple under Steve Jobs used to be about purity: when he wasn’t at the helm in the 90s, it also made the kind of compromises I’m talking about here.\n By “compromise”, Ed means “gave customers what they were asking for”.\nYou’re screwing us  No: the final straw was when you decided to replace the dock on the bottom of all your iPhones and iPads with the new “lightening dock”. I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\n *facepalm*\n You’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\n Firstly, it’s spelled lightning.\nSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out. But it’s also because you can spend $29 on a converter.\nMy chargers are all USB chargers, so I was able to plug the new USB-based Lightning connector in where my old USB-based 30-pin connector was. Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\nLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\n Anyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\n Again, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\nThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years. This is in stark contrast to Android-based devices which are lucky to see a single update ever.\nMacs tend to be supported with the latest updates for 5–6+ years. The latest OS X release, Mountain Lion, supports 2007-era and newer Macs. Considering that the earliest possible Macs that they could support are the first Intel-based Macs (released in 2006), this is pretty darn good.\nI don’t need you any more  I was between iPhones and I filled the lonely miserable gap with an HTC Android phone. And while I tried to ignore it at the time, the fact is, it was actually pretty good. Yes, there were niggles and a few annoyances, but we got along surprisingly well. And I’ll get on pretty well with it again, because the fact is, Tim: I’m leaving you for an Android. I can get everything I need from a phone from them as well.\n Oh, you’re only looking for a phone? Well hey, knock yourself out.\nLast year, I wrote about why Apple’s ecosystem is unmatched and how Android still has a long way to go. If you just want a phone that does some smartphone-like stuff, Android is just fine.\n My email, my messages, maps that work, my contacts (they’re stored with Google anyway and that integrates far better into an Android phone); Evernote, Instapaper, Whatsapp, my tube timetables and bus times. I’ll probably ditch iTunes Match in favour of Amazon Cloud Player or Google Drive, and, frankly, good riddance after the way you’ve treated us mobile users of the service. I’ll miss some of the apps, I’m sure – Reeder to name just one. I’ll miss the hundreds of text messages sitting on my iPhone.

You can still win me back: but you’ll need to do something special again, like you did in the good old days. Reinvent the TV, like you reinvented the phone. Revolutionise finance. Overhaul the home entirely. Think Different – as your predecessor Steve Jobs used to say. Perhaps the problem is you’re not the same person any more. You’re not Steve. Perhaps.\n Reinventing TV takes time. You can’t just take an ancient, out-of-touch industry and change it overnight. Apple took 10 years to build out a successful media platform and top-notch mobile devices.\nIt’s nice that you want Apple do revolutionize everything, but understand that Apple is a business and they need to have the right motivation and opportunity before they can tackle a new market.\nAnd by mentioning Steve, your ignorance is showing. Moron.\n Either way, I’m tired of settling for mediocrity from you these days.\n Some of the best made, best selling products of all time. Blockbuster, record-breaking sales around the world. But because Apple is continuing to hone their skills and continually improve their products over time, they’ve become mediocre.\nAgain, go find your Ritalin and settle your ADHD-ass the **** down.\nConclusion So, Ed, let me get this straight.\n You like your MacBook Air and you don’t want to go back to Windows. You like your iPad (that presumably has iOS 6, and you didn’t mention how anemic the Android tablet market/experience is). You’re frustrated that the tech bloggers complained loudly about Maps and iCloud, even though both work really well. You complain about Apple not supporting their devices, then say you’re going to move to Android. You want Apple to reinvent everything, ever. But they haven’t, so they suck. You want Apple to introduce radical changes to their devices, but complain loudly when they change their mapping provider or introduce a new dock connector.  You, sir, are clearly the king of the morons. Congratulations.\n",
        "source":"\nA [recent editorial on Business Insider]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessinsider.com/dear-apple-im-leaving-you-2012-11\" %}}) layer out a number of reasons why the author, Ed Conway, was “leaving Apple”. This is my response.\n\n## Self-Indulgent Weiner\n\nIn his editorial, [Ed Conway wrote]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessinsider.com/dear-apple-im-leaving-you-2012-11\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Dear Tim,\n\u003e\n\u003e There’s no easy way to put this so I’ll just come right out with it. I’m leaving you. It’s been great (mostly) but it’s over.\n\u003e\n\u003e I figured the least I could do is to explain my decision in full – I like to think it might help protect you from nasty break-ups like this in the future.\n\nI can’t help but think of the “self-indulgent weiner” line delivered by Nicholas Cage as *Memphis Raines* in the movie [Gone in Sixty Seconds]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187078/quotes\" %}}).\n\nEd, you’re going to complain in an effort to get page views. You’re trolling the Apple/anti-Apple crowds to get attention. That, sir, makes you a whore.\n\n## Long-time Apple user\n\n\u003e I’ve been with you, with Apple I mean, for 13 years now – ever since 1999. Perhaps you’ve forgotten: I was a spotty teenager; I bought one of your cute little translucent iBooks. Slowly but surely I painted most parts of my technological life a bright shade of Apple. Let’s see: I’ve owned two iMacs, a number of iBooks, countless Macbooks (I’ve currently got two on the go, for some unknown reason), an iPhone for almost five years, an iPad since the very beginning; iPods, iPod touches, iPod nanos – I’ve had ‘em all. I even invested in an Apple TV and, wait for it, a G4 Power Mac Cube (yes, that was me!).\n\nSo, you’ve been an Apple user for a long time. That’s awesome. It’s made your life better, hasn’t it?\n\n\u003e I’ll admit I became dependent on you – clingy, even. When I went to the States a couple of years back I shelled out hundreds of dollars to ensure I wouldn’t be without an iPhone – even though I was back at college and wasn’t exactly rolling in it. And like so many of those who fall in love with you, soon enough I found myself working part-time as your best PR spokesman: I spent hours persuading all my friends to buy your stuff. I even wrote a blog about what made Apple such a dynamic, innovative and successful company.\n\nBlog *post*. You wrote a blog *post*, you idiot. A “blog” is a *collection* of posts, not a single one. You don’t “write a blog”, you \"write a blog *post*\".\n\nBut that’s neither here nor there. It simply gives me a baseline of your intelligence so that I know whether I can gear my language and logic *up* or *down*. Clearly, it’s *down*.\n\n## The hype\n\n\u003e Like millions of others, I really believed the hype.\n\nYes, because Apple’s success has been built on hype, and hype alone. (If you believe this, then I have some ocean-front property in Arizona to sell you.)\n\nApple builds some of the fastest, [thinnest]({{% wayback \"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401538,00.asp\" %}}) and [lightest]({{% wayback \"http://computers.toptenreviews.com/laptops/apple/apple-macbook-air-review.html\" %}}) computers with incredibly high build quality. The ones with some of the [best displays]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density\" %}}) (in terms of resolution (2880x1800), pixel density (326ppi) and color accuracy), best resale value, and have the [highest consumer rating]({{% wayback \"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2504492/apple-mac/apple--head-and-shoulders--above-phone-rivals-in-satisfaction-survey.html\" %}}). They’re [\\#1 in U.S. unit share for notebooks (Mac)]({{% wayback \"http://www.asymco.com/2012/05/23/the-pc-market-overview-for-q1/\" %}}) (née *laptops*), and [\\#1 in worldwide unit share for tablets (iPads)]({{% wayback \"http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-ipad-market-share-2012-9\" %}}).\n\nThe’ve created not [one]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/osx/\" %}}), but [two]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ios/\" %}}) of the most user-friendly consumer operating systems on the market. They redefined not only [one]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/mac/\" %}}), not even [two]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\" %}}), but [three separate industries]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/\" %}}). And all of their devices work seamlessly together to create a really fantastic experience.\n\nBut no, it’s just hype.\n\n## More uninformed stupidity\n\n\u003e I never thought I would utter these words, but here goes: I’m leaving you. I have already traded in my iPhone for a Samsung.\n\n*A Samsung*. One whole Samsung. \\*facepalm\\*\n\n\u003e Now, I know you don’t like lists (at least I presume that’s why you avoided including a task application in Mac OS and iOS for so many years) but it’s only right that I run through the issues:\n\nThere has been a task manager in Mac OS (classic) as far back as System 1.0, AFAICT. Mac OS X has had a task manager since back in the NeXTStep days (1990’s). iOS didn’t support multitasking until iOS 4 (2010), and even then has chosen not to allow *rampant* or *unchecked* multitasking for user experience and battery life reasons. Every single detail about your last paragraph was 100% incorrect.\n\n## iOS 6\n\n\u003e Yes, I know I’m hardly the first to mention this – but that doesn’t make it any less valid as a complaint. It is truly, truly awful. I’m usually ready to forgive one or two niggles in a new iteration of operating system. After all, they’re usually outweighed by the improvements. In this case, I honestly can’t think of a single new feature that in any way enhances the phone. Every change you’ve made is negative.\n\nThere are *zero* features of iOS 6 that are positive? So then you must think that [every]({{% wayback \"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-6_0/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012166\" %}}) [single]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/\" %}}) one of these features is a bad thing.\n\n* User must confirm access to Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos and Location Data when an app requests them.\n\n* It’s easy to keep contact information up-to-date with Facebook integration.\n\n* Asynchronous Game Center integration which allows for fantastic games like [Letterpress]({{% wayback \"http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/\" %}}) to exist.\n\n* Built-in turn-by-turn navigation. 3D flyover views in Maps.\n\n* Siri has been improved, supports more types of information, and is available on more devices.\n\n* Facebook and Twitter notifications at the OS-level.\n\n* Shared photo streams (accessible to everyone, not just Facebook users).\n\n* The immensely-useful Passbook allows me to start keeping track of gift cards, tickets and other things without having to keep them in my wallet.\n\n* FaceTime conversations over cellular (3G, 4G and LTE).\n\n* Faster JavaScript, and improved CSS 3 and HTML 5 support in Safari.\n\n* The ability to decline calls (regardless of which view you’re in) then send the caller a message instead if you can’t talk right now.\n\n* Do Not Disturb settings for all of those overnight notifications, texts and drunken phone calls.\n\n* Automatic syncing of tabs between Safari on Mac/iPhone/iPad over iCloud.\n\n* Further-improved accessibility settings for people who need them.\n\n\u003e The maps application is utterly horrendous; you must have known this is among the most commonly-used of all functional parts of a smartphone and that to change it quite so substantially would be seriously disruptive.\n\nThe new Apple-powered (instead of Google-powered) Maps app has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Maps load faster (thanks to vector-based rendering), I get turn-by-turn directions with voiceover for free (this used to cost $50 for a third-party app), and the 3D “flyover” view has allowed me to discover a bunch of cool things in downtown Seattle that I never knew existed.\n\nThe only “loss” I experienced was transit maps. This forced me to discover a number of transit mapping applications that are *way* better than what I used to use Google Maps in iOS for. Two apps that I use frequently are [OneBusAway]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onebusaway/id329380089?mt=8\" %}}) and [Lumatic City Maps]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumatic-city-maps/id501673331?mt=8\" %}}). In a pinch, I can use Google Transit Maps in Safari.\n\n\u003e Take iTunes Match. In the previous iOS I could download any individual song in my iTunes Match library, so I could listen to it overseas without data or when in the Tube. Now your dreadful new operating system will only let me download whole albums \\[…\\]\n\nThis is partially false. I use iTunes Match *all the time*. Yes, they’ve removed the one-by-one icons for downloading individual songs. This is a little disappointing, but not super disappointing. I often use playlists (including Smart Playlists) in iTunes, so it’s pretty easy for me to add a song that I want to a playlist, then sync down that playlist.\n\n\u003e \\[…\\] and then won’t let me delete them afterwards, so my iPhone gets clogged up with stuff before arbitrarily deleting precious chunks of data when it reaches capacity.\n\nNot true, but deleting songs is more complicated as you need to turn off iTunes Match, then manually delete individual songs one-by-one from the list view.\n\nThis argument is less moronic than the others… so far.\n\n\u003e As do I find the fact that you now seem to have decided to allow the iOS to decide unilaterally to use the telephone network rather than wifi when it so chooses.\n\nWhat? I have no idea what you’re talking about here.\n\n\u003e Given how badly you screwed up with the whole secret GPS-tracking of iPhone users, I’d have thought you realised we don’t like it when you behave creepily like this. It’s seriously not cool, but then more on that later.\n\nOh, you mean how the [*complete opposite* of your statement is the truth]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html\" %}})?\n\n\u003e All the new, exciting apps you’ve brought in are, I’m afraid to say, rubbish.\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\n\u003e Podcasts: dismal and buggy.\n\nYes, Podcasts 1.0 was a terrible app. But we’re no longer talking about iOS 6.\n\n\u003e Facebook integration: should have been there years ago.\n\nApple gave you what you wanted, and now you’re complaining.\n\n\u003e Passbook: erm – seriously?\n\nOne of my favorite additions, actually. I use it frequently.\n\n\u003e Siri’s improvements are lost on me because, like most users, the only time I’ve engaged with Siri is to see how many swear words he/she/it understands (answer: a surprising number).\n\nI’ll now have to take back my not-so-moronic statement about you that I made earlier.\n\n\u003e Finally, for some reason iOS also seems to have broken the tilt-scrolling in Instapaper, which I resent because, well, I just use that app a lot.\n\nSo do I. And it works. Or were you using the iOS 6 Beta which was in, you know, *beta* status?\n\n## You’ve lost it\n\n\u003e This is going to sound awful, but I can’t think of any big product you’ve re-imagined well since the iPad, and that was almost three years ago.\n\nStupidity should be painful. It seems as though Ed believes that if things don’t change radically from one iteration to the next, then they suck. Dude, take your Ritalin and calm your ADHD-ass the \\*\\*\\*\\* down.\n\n\u003e iCloud? Not as good as dropbox, and actually more confusing. FaceTime? Slick, but still pales in comparison with Skype. iMessages? Mostly annoying, particularly when it sends messages twice. Siri? See the previous point. Safari? Not as good as Chrome or Firefox. Safari’s Reader function? Not as good as Instapaper. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\n\nApple has been doing this for a while, so I’m surprised that Ed — a 13-year Apple veteran — hasn’t been paying attention.\n\nApple does not try to *replace* existing apps and functionality. Rather, it seeks to chase them up the bean pole. In other words, Apple comes in to the entry level of the market (informing some people that such a market exists in the first place), and challenges the incumbents to provide mid- and advanced-level features for people who want more.\n\n* iCloud: Handles your fundamental syncing tasks across devices with zero effort.\n\n* FaceTime: Always-on. Just tap the contact info of a friend or family member with a Mac, iPhone or iPad, and the call begins. No signing up. No ads. Simple.\n\n* iMessages: I can send and receive messages to other Mac/iPhone/iPad users from my Mac/iPhone/iPad. Messages sync across all devices so I never have to wonder where they went.\n\n* Siri: Fantastic. Easy to send text messages to people via voice while I’m driving. Easy to look up turn-by-turn directions. Easy to find a list of nearby Thai restaurants, with user-submitted reviews, ratings and price information.\n\n* Safari: Safari is incredibly fast on Mac and iOS. It’s become my preferred browser over both Chrome and Firefox because of this.\n\n* Safari’s Reader function: Most people don’t realize that you can read websites with all of the ads and crap stripped out of them. Instapaper led the charge, but Pocket is also coming along. Safari Reader is an entry-level feature.\n\n\u003e Plus, my Mac simply doesn’t work that well any more. The contacts on my iPhone don’t seem to sync very well with my laptop. Aperture is extraordinarily slow and buggy, Pages and Numbers are a bit of a nonsense. It just feels like you don’t make the best software anymore. And it doesn’t fit together as seamlessly as in the past.\n\nSOMETHING IS WRONG! FIX IT! MAKE IT WORK!\n\nI don’t have any of the technical problems Ed’s talking about (e.g., contact syncing). I like Pages, but I prefer to write in Markdown using [iA Writer]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12\" %}}). I have no need for Numbers. Since all of Ed’s assertions are unqualified and he fails to explain anything, it’s clear that he’s just ranting about things he doesn’t (or hasn’t taken the time to) understand.\n\n## You’re not cool anymore\n\n\u003e Again, this is probably a body blow, but it’s also true. It’s not merely that I now have to put up with your products being used by my mother. The fact is that Apple used to be edgy; it used to be associated with the counterculture; it used to be rebellious. I liked that. I liked the fact that you were uncompromising. \\[…\\]\n\nYes, and Apple also almost went bankrupt in 1996. They were rebels without a clue. Now they’re wildly successful because they chose *not* to follow in the footsteps of other companies… and you’re *mad?*\n\n\u003e When you introduced the iMac you ditched the serial ports and insisted everyone had to make do with USB ports, despite the fact there was approximately one printer in the world which worked with USB. You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos. There was something cool about that attitude.\n\nNone… (reading…) yep, none of those things have changed.\n\n\u003e These days, you’re all too ready to compromise. Do you want to know the beginning of the end of our relationship? It was when you decided to include an SD slot in your MacBooks. Why? I can’t imagine the Apple of old ever doing this; there is no inherent reason why you need one in your laptop, save to compromise. And in compromising, you’ve become too complex.\n\nUser research showed that lots and lots of people were using SD cards in their cameras and other devices, so Apple added an SD card reader into their laptops. Apple did what made things *simpler* for users.\n\n\u003e I remember the first iMac: it was the first computer you didn’t really need an instruction manual for. When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use. That’s the first time I’ve ever had to use an Apple instruction manual.\n\nYou swipe. You tap. If you want to check out the settings, you tap on “Settings”. It’s really not complex. Both my son and my daughter (elementary school age) were able to pick up my iPhone (and later my iPad) and begin using them *immediately* with zero instruction.\n\nWhat does that say about you, Ed?\n\n\u003e Apple used to be about purity, which in turn made its products simpler and more reliable; somewhere along the way, this got lost. Or rather, Apple under Steve Jobs used to be about purity: when he wasn’t at the helm in the 90s, it also made the kind of compromises I’m talking about here.\n\nBy “compromise”, Ed means “gave customers what they were asking for”.\n\n## You’re screwing us\n\n\u003e No: the final straw was when you decided to replace the dock on the bottom of all your iPhones and iPads with the new “lightening dock”. I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\n\n\\*facepalm\\*\n\n\u003e You’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\n\nFirstly, it’s spelled *lightning*.\n\nSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out. But it’s also because you can spend [$29 on a converter]({{% wayback \"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD823/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter\" %}}).\n\nMy chargers are all USB chargers, so I was able to plug the new USB-based Lightning connector in where my old USB-based 30-pin connector was. Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\n\nLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\n\n\u003e Anyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\n\nAgain, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\n\nThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years. This is in stark contrast to Android-based devices which are lucky to see a single update *ever*.\n\nMacs tend to be supported with the latest updates for 5–6+ years. The latest OS X release, Mountain Lion, supports 2007-era and newer Macs. Considering that the earliest possible Macs that they could support are the first Intel-based Macs (released in 2006), this is pretty darn good.\n\n## I don’t need you any more\n\n\u003e I was between iPhones and I filled the lonely miserable gap with an HTC Android phone. And while I tried to ignore it at the time, the fact is, it was actually pretty good. Yes, there were niggles and a few annoyances, but we got along surprisingly well. And I’ll get on pretty well with it again, because the fact is, Tim: I’m leaving you for an Android. I can get everything I need from a phone from them as well.\n\nOh, you’re *only* looking for a phone? Well hey, knock yourself out.\n\nLast year, [I wrote about why Apple’s ecosystem is unmatched](/2011/09/05/skating-to-where-the-puck-will-be/) and how Android still has a long way to go. If you just want a phone that does some smartphone-like stuff, Android is just fine.\n\n\u003e My email, my messages, maps that work, my contacts (they’re stored with Google anyway and that integrates far better into an Android phone); Evernote, Instapaper, Whatsapp, my tube timetables and bus times. I’ll probably ditch iTunes Match in favour of Amazon Cloud Player or Google Drive, and, frankly, good riddance after the way you’ve treated us mobile users of the service. I’ll miss some of the apps, I’m sure – Reeder to name just one. I’ll miss the hundreds of text messages sitting on my iPhone. I’ll miss… Actually, I can’t think of anything else right now.\n\nIf you’re invested in the Google platform for your contacts, calendars and email, then the Google mobile OS might be a good fit for you. I used Google for contacts and calendars for 4 years and have used Google for email since I got into the Gmail beta in May 2004. But I’ll tell you: Moving my contacts and calendars to iCloud has been a very positive experience. Not only does contact syncing over iCloud work better, but sharing calendars with other people allows for notifications about changes for all people involved. I couldn’t get this with Google Calendar.\n\nI’ve used Amazon Cloud Player on Android 4.0.4 (CyanogenMod 9) and iOS, and quite frankly, it sucks. It crashes often, it doesn’t use *my* album artwork, and it only supports the popular-but-inefficient MP3 audio codec. It also doesn’t integrate with iTunes on my Mac. [DoubleTwist]({{% wayback \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer\" %}}) is tolerable, but the integration isn’t as good there either.\n\nGoogle Music still requires you to upload all of your music. I have hundreds of gigabytes, so that simply isn’t going to happen.\n\n\u003e I’ll hang onto my iPad for the time being. I’ll certainly keep the Macbook Air – I’m not quite ready to return to Windows yet.\n\nMight not buy a Mac, but not ready to go back to Windows? Where else is there to go? Desktop Linux?\n\n\u003e Don’t take it personally. Well, do, if it helps inspire you to make better and bolder products. This need not be forever. You can still win me back: but you’ll need to do something special again, like you did in the good old days. Reinvent the TV, like you reinvented the phone. Revolutionise finance. Overhaul the home entirely. Think Different – as your predecessor Steve Jobs used to say. Perhaps the problem is you’re not the same person any more. You’re not Steve. Perhaps.\n\nReinventing TV takes time. You can’t just take an ancient, out-of-touch industry and change it overnight. Apple took 10 years to build out a successful media platform and top-notch mobile devices.\n\nIt’s nice that you want Apple do revolutionize *everything*, but understand that Apple is a business and they need to have the right motivation and opportunity before they can tackle a new market.\n\nAnd by mentioning Steve, your ignorance is showing. Moron.\n\n\u003e Either way, I’m tired of settling for mediocrity from you these days.\n\nSome of the best made, best selling products of all time. Blockbuster, record-breaking sales around the world. But because Apple is continuing to hone their skills and continually improve their products over time, they’ve become mediocre.\n\nAgain, go find your Ritalin and settle your ADHD-ass the \\*\\*\\*\\* down.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, Ed, let me get this straight.\n\n* You like your MacBook Air and you don’t want to go back to Windows.\n* You like your iPad (that presumably has iOS 6, and you didn’t mention how anemic the Android tablet market/experience is).\n* You’re frustrated that the tech bloggers complained loudly about Maps and iCloud, even though both work really well.\n* You complain about Apple not supporting their devices, then say you’re going to move to *Android*.\n* You want Apple to reinvent *everything, ever*. But they haven’t, so they suck.\n* You want Apple to introduce radical changes to their devices, but complain loudly when they change their mapping provider or introduce a new dock connector.\n\nYou, sir, are clearly the king of the morons.

What I do know, however, are all of the things that Technical Recruiters do that drive me absolutely crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all recruiters do these things so I don’t hate them all, but generally speaking, the entire technical recruiting industry has made a very bad name for itself amongst the people they’re trying to recruit. Speaking for myself, and a number of people I’ve worked with over the past 10 years, here is a list of things that drive us nuts as well as suggestions for how things could be better between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-key-to-this-business-is-personal-relationships\"\u003eThe key to this business is personal relationships\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those who have never seen \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111105202232/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/\"\u003eJerry MacGuire\u003c/a\u003e, Jerry is a sports agent who one day has an epiphany about how to radically improve the way his company works with its clients. Thinking back, he recalled what his mentor had to say: \u0026ldquo;The key to this business is \u003cem\u003epersonal relationships\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rdquo; Fewer clients, less money. Jerry wrote up a manifesto, delivered it to everyone in his company, and was fired the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jerry_macguire.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe was mocked and abandoned by everyone he knew except for a single client who decided to stick with him. In the end, Jerry’s new philosophy pays off in spades for himself and his client. Instead of trying to be the biggest, he decided to be the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is precisely what the technical recruiting industry in desperate need of — to re-focus on building personal relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whos-the-customer\"\u003eWho’s the customer?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that this is the reason why relationship-building has fallen by the wayside: Who’s the customer? Who’s interests are the recruiter’s aligned with? Technical \u003cem\u003epeople\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ecompanies?\u003c/em\u003e The answer for most recruiting firms is the companies who write the checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how they make a living, so it’s not unreasonable, but it tends to cause a breakdown in how recruiters and professionals see each other. The companies are the customers, and we technical-folk are the products. You procure products for the customers, and let the customers pick and choose which products they want — kind of like picking out the apples you want to buy at the grocery store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we technical-folk don’t see ourselves as a product to be collected and sold to the customer. We see ourselves as the customers, looking for the right products (i.e., companies) to invest in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking from personal experience, there was once a recruiter who was very nice to me when I approached her about companies that may be hiring. She had one \u003cem\u003ehawt startup\u003c/em\u003e that was looking for a \u003cem\u003erock star\u003c/em\u003e, and sent me some information about them. I read through it, called her back, and told her that I didn’t think it would be a good fit because they were looking for someone who did things that I didn’t, and I wasn’t particularly interested in their problem-space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe then told me that I would never get anywhere in this industry if I wasn’t willing to grow, and decided to schedule an interview for me anyway. She asked me when I could talk to them, and I naïvely said “in about an hour” thinking it would be a phone interview. She scheduled an in-person interview instead, even though I lived two-hours away. I caved, told her to push out the interview by an hour, and went and talked to them. After the interview, I still felt like it wasn’t a good fit. I called her back, told her that I wasn’t interested in pursuing this company any further, and asked if she had anything else. I never heard from her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of who writes the checks, recruiting agencies typically align themselves with the companies they’re hiring for instead of the people they’re trying to recruit. Out of necessity or not, this alone puts technical people at odds with technical recruiters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"should-you-send-that-email-or-not\"\u003eShould you send that email or not?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I learned in college was how to put together a quality résumé, and how to apply for a professional job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had the opportunity to have a chat with an HR/Recruiting manager from a local business who explained that businesses get tons of résumés every day, and that a lot of people were applying for positions that they were clearly not qualified for. So she explained to us:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do your homework. Don’t apply for a job where you’re clearly not a good fit with the hope that maybe you’ll have a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really wish technical recruiters would have taken that same course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a game that’s played during the recruiting process called “Buzzword Bingo”. Both sides play it, but because technical-folk have the skills that the companies are looking for, technical-folk play it a lot better than recruiters do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA technical résumé might explain a process by which a very large dataset was iteratively filtered down to a singular result. The hiring company knows that this process is called MapReduce. The technical person knows that this process is called MapReduce. Recruiters don’t typically know that this is called MapReduce. So, technical people will explicitly list “MapReduce” on their résumé so that it can get matched in recruiter databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/buzzword_bingo.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, some recruiters will simply search their databases for “MapReduce” and send messages to everyone that matches. The hiring company may be doing MapReduce in Java in a traditional datacenter, while a technical person may be doing MapReduce in Python in a cloud computing environment. The hiring company is not a match for the technical person, and vice-versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of \u003ca href=\"/2011/10/26/clueless-recruiters/\"\u003elast week’s \u003cem\u003eClueless Recruiters\u003c/em\u003e piece\u003c/a\u003e, there was a little more conversation that happened after I had stopped writing, where it was explained that that firm’s thought process is, \u0026ldquo;Well, what’s the harm of sending the email? If it’s not a good fit, most people just ignore it. But not \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is exactly what’s wrong with technical recruiting agencies — they don’t do their homework first before sending an email. In doing so, they waste everybody’s time and attention with what ends up being tantamount to spam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/profile.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"dont-ask-for-my-colleagues-information\"\u003eDon’t ask for my colleagues’ information\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe technical-folk are very aware that the way recruiters make money is by matching people with companies.

        "plain":"I’ve been accused of not knowing how to do a Technical Recruiter’s job, so I have no business telling them how to do it. That’s a fair assertion. What I do know, however, are all of the things that Technical Recruiters do that drive me absolutely crazy.\nNot all recruiters do these things so I don’t hate them all, but generally speaking, the entire technical recruiting industry has made a very bad name for itself amongst the people they’re trying to recruit. Speaking for myself, and a number of people I’ve worked with over the past 10 years, here is a list of things that drive us nuts as well as suggestions for how things could be better between us.\nThe key to this business is personal relationships For those who have never seen Jerry MacGuire, Jerry is a sports agent who one day has an epiphany about how to radically improve the way his company works with its clients. Thinking back, he recalled what his mentor had to say: \u0026ldquo;The key to this business is personal relationships.\u0026rdquo; Fewer clients, less money. Jerry wrote up a manifesto, delivered it to everyone in his company, and was fired the next day.\n  He was mocked and abandoned by everyone he knew except for a single client who decided to stick with him. In the end, Jerry’s new philosophy pays off in spades for himself and his client. Instead of trying to be the biggest, he decided to be the best.\nThis is precisely what the technical recruiting industry in desperate need of — to re-focus on building personal relationships.\nWho’s the customer? I believe that this is the reason why relationship-building has fallen by the wayside: Who’s the customer? Who’s interests are the recruiter’s aligned with? Technical people or companies? The answer for most recruiting firms is the companies who write the checks.\nThis is how they make a living, so it’s not unreasonable, but it tends to cause a breakdown in how recruiters and professionals see each other. The companies are the customers, and we technical-folk are the products. You procure products for the customers, and let the customers pick and choose which products they want — kind of like picking out the apples you want to buy at the grocery store.\nBut we technical-folk don’t see ourselves as a product to be collected and sold to the customer. We see ourselves as the customers, looking for the right products (i.e., companies) to invest in.\nSpeaking from personal experience, there was once a recruiter who was very nice to me when I approached her about companies that may be hiring. She had one hawt startup that was looking for a rock star, and sent me some information about them. I read through it, called her back, and told her that I didn’t think it would be a good fit because they were looking for someone who did things that I didn’t, and I wasn’t particularly interested in their problem-space.\nShe then told me that I would never get anywhere in this industry if I wasn’t willing to grow, and decided to schedule an interview for me anyway. She asked me when I could talk to them, and I naïvely said “in about an hour” thinking it would be a phone interview. She scheduled an in-person interview instead, even though I lived two-hours away. I caved, told her to push out the interview by an hour, and went and talked to them. After the interview, I still felt like it wasn’t a good fit. I called her back, told her that I wasn’t interested in pursuing this company any further, and asked if she had anything else. I never heard from her again.\nBecause of who writes the checks, recruiting agencies typically align themselves with the companies they’re hiring for instead of the people they’re trying to recruit. Out of necessity or not, this alone puts technical people at odds with technical recruiters.\nShould you send that email or not? One of the things I learned in college was how to put together a quality résumé, and how to apply for a professional job.\nWe had the opportunity to have a chat with an HR/Recruiting manager from a local business who explained that businesses get tons of résumés every day, and that a lot of people were applying for positions that they were clearly not qualified for. So she explained to us:\n “Do your homework. Don’t apply for a job where you’re clearly not a good fit with the hope that maybe you’ll have a chance.”\n I really wish technical recruiters would have taken that same course.\nThere’s a game that’s played during the recruiting process called “Buzzword Bingo”. Both sides play it, but because technical-folk have the skills that the companies are looking for, technical-folk play it a lot better than recruiters do.\nA technical résumé might explain a process by which a very large dataset was iteratively filtered down to a singular result. The hiring company knows that this process is called MapReduce. The technical person knows that this process is called MapReduce. Recruiters don’t typically know that this is called MapReduce. So, technical people will explicitly list “MapReduce” on their résumé so that it can get matched in recruiter databases.\n  Unfortunately, some recruiters will simply search their databases for “MapReduce” and send messages to everyone that matches. The hiring company may be doing MapReduce in Java in a traditional datacenter, while a technical person may be doing MapReduce in Python in a cloud computing environment. The hiring company is not a match for the technical person, and vice-versa.\nAs a result of last week’s Clueless Recruiters piece, there was a little more conversation that happened after I had stopped writing, where it was explained that that firm’s thought process is, \u0026ldquo;Well, what’s the harm of sending the email? If it’s not a good fit, most people just ignore it. But not you.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is exactly what’s wrong with technical recruiting agencies — they don’t do their homework first before sending an email. In doing so, they waste everybody’s time and attention with what ends up being tantamount to spam.\n  Don’t ask for my colleagues’ information We technical-folk are very aware that the way recruiters make money is by matching people with companies. It’s pretty ballsy, and quite frankly rude, when you ask \u0026ldquo;If you or anyone you know is interested…“. We don’t believe that you’re trying to help anyone get a job. What we do believe, however, is that you’re trying to get paid. True or false, this is what we believe. When we read this, we can’t help but think ”Wait, you want me to do your job for you? No thanks.\u0026rdquo; You clearly didn’t bother to do your homework when you contacted me. Why would I think that you would treat my colleague any better?\nStop being lazy and do your own job.\nDon’t call me at work, or email me at work If you do, you are a particularly stupid person. For obvious reasons.\nStick to professional networks There are plenty of social networks that are geared toward professionals. LinkedIn, Plaxo, Zerply, and good ol’ email. If you’re going to try to recruit someone, stick to places like these. Even Twitter is tolerable.\nYou know what’s intolerable? Here’s a message I received this morning on Facebook from someone I don’t know.\n Hi Ryan,\ni have a JAVA position in Santa Clara,CA,PLZ Send me your updated to resume to [email],if you are interested.\n I swear I can’t make this shit up.\nBut you know what will earn you an I-will-punch-you-in-the-throat,-bitch reaction? Trying to recruit me on Match.com.\nOver the summer, I was meeting girls and going on dates. There was one girl who was cute, and we seemed to have a lot in common. We were talking, trying to figure out the details of our first date together. After we settled on the time and place, we had the following conversation over text message:\n Her: So, do you know Java, JBoss or Spring?\nMe: ’scuse me? No. Why?\nHer: Shoot! I have an open req’ to fill, and it would make me a lot of money. Do you know anybody who does?\nMe: Hold on — you’re asking me to pimp out my professional network to you before we’ve even had our first date? Are you a recruiter or something?\nHer: Yeah, why?\nMe: I’m sorry. You seem like a really nice girl and I wish you the best of luck, but I don’t think this is going to work out.\n I was so completely appalled by this woman’s behavior, that I just sat there with stunned speechlessness for about 20 minutes. Now, granted, this was a pretty extreme abuse of social networking, but it does happen.\nConclusion I generally find that whenever I talk about my distaste for technical recruiters, to technical recruiters, the responses typically fall into one of two camps:\n  Defensive: These are the people who defend what they do, come Hell or high-water, and then turn around to accuse me of not knowing anything about recruiting so I should just shut-up. These are the recruiters who think that they’re doing us all a service and we should be thankful for their work.\n  Understanding: These are the people who know that the recruiting industry is a mess, and are actively trying to change the reputation their industry has developed with technical-folk. These are the people I’m far more inclined to work with.\n  Recruiters claim that they don’t have enough time to Google each and every person they send messages to. That’s… unfortunate. I’m certain that if more effort were applied to ensuring that the messages that recruiters sent to technical-folk were a likely fit instead of simply blasting out cattle-calls, people wouldn’t hate recruiters so much, and there would be a better working relationship all the way around.\nSee Also… Here are some similar thoughts by other people, which bear a striking resemblance to the qualms I have with the technical recruiting industry:\n Why are technical recruiters so clueless? Death By Recruiters Recruiters suck Why most recruiters suck and what you can do about it Another Year, Another Reason to Hate Technical Recruiters  Update (2012–02–28) Speaking of people who send out emails without actually bothering to do any homework first, here’s a great example of the kind of idiocy that these people portray. While this person isn’t a technical recruiter per sé, he has shown the same sort of neglect for the details that the majority of technical recruiters do.\n  In case you’re not sure what you’re looking at, this person emailed Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon.com, about promoting Rackspace on his personal blog. Rackspace is a direct competitor to Amazon Web Services in the Cloud Computing market. If Zach Burton had bothered to do even a few minutes worth of homework before opening his mouth (or keyboard), he wouldn’t have made so much an ass of himself.\nThese are the kinds of people that I enjoy skewering in my Clueless Recruiters pieces — the people who are simply too lazy to do a good job.\nUpdate (2013–03–23) Matt Youell has some very similar thoughts on the matter.\n “Tech companies seem to be having trouble finding good technical talent.

That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranslation: “We’re sorry that we did a poor job of telling you bad news, but the bad news was going to happen no matter what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany members love our DVD service, as I do, because nearly every movie ever made is published on DVD, plus lots of TV series. We want to advertise the breadth of our incredible DVD offering so that as many people as possible know it still exists, and it is a great option for those who want the huge and comprehensive selection on DVD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have a crap-ton of content available on DVD.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDVD by mail may not last forever, but we want it to last as long as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DVDs by mail is a dying business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also love our streaming service because it is integrated into my TV, and I can watch anytime I want. The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail. We feel we need to focus on rapid improvement as streaming technology and the market evolve, without having to maintain compatibility with our DVD by mail service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DVDs are old and busted. Streaming is the new hotness — the new shiny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blah, blah, internal corporate structure, blah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard for me to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary and best: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m retarded.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated. So if you subscribe to both services, and if you need to change your credit card or email address, you would need to do it in two places. Similarly, if you rate or review a movie on Qwikster, it doesn’t show up on Netflix, and vice-versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nevermind that web services and data integration are commonplace across the web in this day and age.

But he’s dead wrong about it being much different. Obviously he’s never watched people use web applications before. Changing websites is not even close to the same thing as changing tabs. When you change websites you go somewhere different, you get a different UI, you’re using a different username, and you probably have to log in. You have a different payment system. Different family members to add. Different recommendations to look at. And that’s just for starters. […]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a fundamental change in the product, and Hastings just dismisses the concern with a wave of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, the team at Netflix — known for its engineering prowess — has overlooked how its “not that much different” changes will affect the overall customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, people don’t think they’re buying two services right now…they’re simply buying Netflix.

You’re not a DVD company and a streaming company: you’re where I go to watch movies. That’s it.

        "plain":"Reed Hastings seems like a bright guy. He handily trounced the incumbent DVD rental giants (e.g., Blockbuster, Hollywood Video), and currently has a commanding lead in the movie streaming market. So why on earth is he destroying what he’s built?\n  What’s happening to Netflix? Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, recently wrote a blog post to customers about some upcoming changes to the Netflix we know today:\n It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\n Translation: “We’re sorry that we did a poor job of telling you bad news, but the bad news was going to happen no matter what.”\n Many members love our DVD service, as I do, because nearly every movie ever made is published on DVD, plus lots of TV series. We want to advertise the breadth of our incredible DVD offering so that as many people as possible know it still exists, and it is a great option for those who want the huge and comprehensive selection on DVD.\n “We have a crap-ton of content available on DVD.”\n DVD by mail may not last forever, but we want it to last as long as possible.\n “DVDs by mail is a dying business.”\n I also love our streaming service because it is integrated into my TV, and I can watch anytime I want. The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail. We feel we need to focus on rapid improvement as streaming technology and the market evolve, without having to maintain compatibility with our DVD by mail service.\n “DVDs are old and busted. Streaming is the new hotness — the new shiny.”\n So we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.\n “Blah, blah, internal corporate structure, blah.”\n It’s hard for me to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary and best: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”.\n “I’m retarded.”\n A negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated. So if you subscribe to both services, and if you need to change your credit card or email address, you would need to do it in two places. Similarly, if you rate or review a movie on Qwikster, it doesn’t show up on Netflix, and vice-versa.\n “Nevermind that web services and data integration are commonplace across the web in this day and age. Bring back the 90’s!”\n The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n Let’s bookmark this.\nThe Reaction The reaction is overwhelmingly negative, from tech industry insiders and non-techies alike.\n  When I first read Reed’s blog post on Sunday night, there were 245 comments. This morning, there were 11,237 comments. As I write this, there are 21,747 21,872 comments — nearly every single one of them is outraged by what this means for customers.\nAs usual, Twitter is aflutter with comments.\nDeanna Raybourn:\n Paul Medico:\n Ben Zibble:\n Matt Dudley (deleted):\n Imagine if @Netflix and Qwikster combined services… unlimited DVD rentals and streaming. Now THAT would be awesome.\n And here’s my personal favorite, from Wonderella:\n (Bonus: The Oatmeal and The Joy of Tech chime in.)\nPersonally, I’ve not only been a Netflix customer for a long time (since 2005-ish), but I’ve also been a Netflix fan. I didn’t mind so much when they split up the DVD/streaming accounts and started charging a little more. Netflix + Hulu has completely replaced my cable package.\nI suppose my concerns are mostly around the usability of everything. There are lots of third-party services trying to make it easier to watch what you want, regardless of the service. I look up movie/show descriptions on IMDb, movie posters from The Movie DB, stream content from Hulu or Netflix, download content from iTunes, or get a DVD by mail from Netflix (for titles that aren’t available digitally). I would love to see more integration, rather than fragmenting the services even more.\nA Fundamental Change in the Product Joshua Porter of Bokardo.com had this to say:\n Netflix is taking a huge risk here. They’re changing the user experience of their web apps to model the new company structure, not a structure that is most friendly to people. This is an extremely common problem in user interface design. Netflix is in serious danger of breaking the user experience they are well-known for.\n If you read through even a fraction of comments on the aforementioned Netflix blog post, a very large percentage of users agree with this analysis. Almost everybody has the same concern.\n   As one commenter complains there will now be two separate movie queues, one on Netflix for DVD and one on Qwikster for streaming. Hastings’ response is dismissive:\n We already have two queues. The two “sites” are a click between each other, so we think not that much different than two tabs on one site.\n Technically, Hastings is right about there already being two queues. But he’s dead wrong about it being much different. Obviously he’s never watched people use web applications before. Changing websites is not even close to the same thing as changing tabs. When you change websites you go somewhere different, you get a different UI, you’re using a different username, and you probably have to log in. You have a different payment system. Different family members to add. Different recommendations to look at. And that’s just for starters. […]\nThis is a fundamental change in the product, and Hastings just dismisses the concern with a wave of his hand.\n Clearly, the team at Netflix — known for its engineering prowess — has overlooked how its “not that much different” changes will affect the overall customer experience.\n Also, people don’t think they’re buying two services right now…they’re simply buying Netflix. As another commenter points out:\n You’re continuing to make a classic mistake: thinking you’re something different than what everyone believes you are. You’re not a DVD company and a streaming company: you’re where I go to watch movies. That’s it. The future clearly is streaming, but by separating and charging more for access, you’re wildly less valuable to me. I’ll likely cancel. You haven’t listened to customer feedback. You’re delusional and you’re lost.\u0026rdquo;\n  Railroad companies failed to understand that they were in the transportation business and were surpassed by the airlines. Newspaper companies failed to understand that they were in the information business and were surpassed by blogs. Record stores failed to understand that they were in the business of selling music and the were surpassed by the Napster Revolution. It’s a classic mistake.\nCatalog Size, Deintegration and Price-Hikes — Oh My! Netflix’ current streaming selection is, at best, abysmal. A couple of months ago, I was getting ready to move and decided to digitize my DVD collection so that I wouldn’t have to drag them along with me. I figured that most of my movies would be available for streaming, so that would save me the time of digitizing the DVDs that I didn’t need to.\nAs it turned out, I ended up having to digitize the majority of my DVDs because they weren’t available for streaming. I’m still working my way through the stack.\n  Earlier in the summer, Netflix decided to separate the DVD and streaming plans into separate offerings, with separate pricing for each. Despite Netflix’ best efforts to spin it positively, customers didn’t buy the explanation. Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch said it best:\n Raising prices for those of us who opt for both streaming and DVDs would have been fine if Netflix had a deeper streaming catalog. But the gap is still too big, and the price hike seemed premature. Your customers are extremely loyal. Don’t piss them off.\n (Aside: Bill Gurley from Above the Crowd makes a very interesting case for why he believes Netflix was forced to raise their prices. I would likely end up quoting his entire piece here, so I’ll just link to \u0026ldquo;Understanding Why Netflix Changed Pricing\u0026rdquo; instead.)\nA few months before that, Netflix removed the ability for customers to add movies to their DVD queues from non-computer devices. If you look up a movie on your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii or other non-computer device, and it isn’t available for streaming, you need to do the search all over again from your computer before you can add it to your queue.\nNow Netflix is looking to make a move that is making customers even angrier: Not only are they separating the DVD and streaming queues into separate websites, but they’re also separating user accounts, credit card updates, ratings, reviews, recommendations, and everything else. Instead of the simplicity of one location for your movies, you now have to deal with two.\nWhither Qwikster? Back to Reed Hastings’ blog post:\n Andy Rendich, who has been working on our DVD service for 12 years, and leading it for the last 4 years, will be the CEO of Qwikster. Andy and I made a short welcome video. (You’ll probably say we should avoid going into movie making after watching it.) We will let you know in a few weeks when the Qwikster.com website is up and ready. It is merely a renamed version of the Netflix DVD website, but with the addition of video games. You won’t have to do anything special if you subscribe to our DVD by mail service. […]\nSome members will likely feel that we shouldn’t split the businesses, and that we shouldn’t rename our DVD by mail service. […] But going forward, Qwikster will continue to run the best DVD by mail service ever, throughout the United States. Netflix will offer the best streaming service for TV shows and movies, hopefully on a global basis.\n Streaming is the future. Everybody knows it. You know it, I know it, Reed Hastings knows it, and Andy Rendich sure as heck knows it. When was the last time you decided to add a movie to your DVD queue if it was already available for streaming? When is streaming ever not your first choice?\n  Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch breaks down the numbers:\n Still, it’s not enough to offset the drop-off in DVD subscribers. Of the 1 million fewer subscribers Netflix now expects, 800,000 will be from DVD-only subscribers. The remaining 200,000 decline will come from streaming-only subs, with the number who pay for both remaining steady. Out of Netflix’s expected 24 million subscribers this year, 21.8 million will have access to streaming in some form, and only 2.2 million will stick to DVD-only subscriptions.\n That doesn’t sound like a very large business. As a matter of fact, that’s a business that’s shrinking. Surely Andy Rendich has seen these numbers, so why would he agree to become the new CEO of a born-to-fail business?\nCrazy or Genius? Looking at this series of events from the outside, I can only see two possible rationales that explain why they’re doing what they’re doing.\n They’re bat-shit crazy. They know something that we don’t, which will make all of this headache worth it.  Reed Hastings and Co. have always seemed like a sharp bunch. They started the company with the notion of putting the customer first and over time they have built a successful business around that premise.\n  Recently, Netflix and Starz decided to end their business relationship, yet Reed Hastings said:\n The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n I can’t help but compare present-day Netflix to Apple in 1985. The Macintosh was clearly the future of computing, but after a solid start, sales were starting to drop off. There weren’t enough applications and the hardware was considered too expensive. The Apple II, on the other hand, was a cash-cow with a large application library at its disposal. Steve Jobs ended up losing his job over the “failure” of the Macintosh.

That said, I can’t help but feel that in their rush to move into the future, they’re bungling the present.

You won’t have to do anything special if you subscribe to our DVD by mail service. \\[…\\]\n\u003e\n\u003e Some members will likely feel that we shouldn’t split the businesses, and that we shouldn’t rename our DVD by mail service. \\[…\\] But going forward, Qwikster will continue to run the best DVD by mail service ever, throughout the United States. Netflix will offer the best streaming service for TV shows and movies, hopefully on a global basis.\n\nStreaming is the future. Everybody knows it. You know it, I know it, Reed Hastings knows it, and Andy Rendich sure as heck knows it. When was the last time you decided to add a movie to your DVD queue if it was already available for streaming? When is streaming ever *not* your first choice?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/qwikster.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"273\" \u003e}}\n\nErick Schonfeld of Techcrunch [breaks down the numbers]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/18/netflix-wall-street/\" %}}):\n\n\u003e Still, it’s not enough to offset the drop-off in DVD subscribers. Of the 1 million fewer subscribers Netflix now expects, 800,000 will be from DVD-only subscribers. The remaining 200,000 decline will come from streaming-only subs, with the number who pay for both remaining steady. Out of Netflix’s expected 24 million subscribers this year, 21.8 million will have access to streaming in some form, and only 2.2 million will stick to DVD-only subscriptions.\n\nThat doesn’t sound like a very large business. As a matter of fact, that’s a business that’s *shrinking*. Surely Andy Rendich has seen these numbers, so why would he agree to become the new CEO of a born-to-fail business?\n\n## Crazy or Genius?\n\nLooking at this series of events from the outside, I can only see two possible rationales that explain why they’re doing what they’re doing.\n\n1. They’re bat-shit crazy.\n2. They know something that we don’t, which will make all of this headache worth it.\n\nReed Hastings and Co. have always seemed like a sharp bunch. They started the company with the notion of putting the customer first and over time they have built a successful business around that premise.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/einstein-crazy.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"279\" \u003e}}\n\nRecently, Netflix and [Starz]({{% wayback \"http://starz.com\" %}}) decided to end their business relationship, yet Reed Hastings said:\n\n\u003e The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n\nI can’t help but compare present-day Netflix to Apple in 1985. The Macintosh was clearly the future of computing, but after a solid start, sales were starting to drop off. There weren’t enough applications and the hardware was considered too expensive. The Apple II, on the other hand, was a cash-cow with a large application library at its disposal. Steve Jobs ended up losing his job over the “failure” of the Macintosh. Fast-forward to today: Macs are selling like hotcakes — faster than the entire computer industry — and the *Apple* line of computers died out 25 years ago.\n\nI think Netflix currently finds itself in a similar position. They know that streaming is the future, if not the *now*. They are working to grow their streaming content library every day. No, the amount of content comes nowhere near that of their DVDs-by-mail business, but it will.\n\nQwikster will eventually fade into a footnote in history — and I believe that this has been the plan all along. What better way to sunset the legacy product and grow the new product than to remove the distractions entirely? All of the built-up brand equity is staying with their newer product, streaming video, while the legacy product gets pushed out the back door with a stupid name and a $20-bill pinned to its collar. This isn’t an accident.\n\nI hope that the team at Netflix continues to ride the fine line between crazy and genius for all it’s worth. That said, I can’t help but feel that in their rush to move into the future, they’re *bungling* the present. Hastings and Rendich need to take a moment to slow down, listen to what customers *want* (instead of just what they’re *asking for*), and make this transition from DVDs to streaming as smooth as possible.\n"},

He’s that stupid.\nOn the up-shot, Mr. Firefox knows that he’s retarded, so to deal with this he surrounds himself with a bunch of really good people that he knows he can trust.

This dirty cop has been taking bribes from Iranian terrorists to tell Mr. Firefox that it’s perfectly safe to drive you into a lake.

Well, this is what has happened to the Internet over the past few weeks. You trust your web browser, your web browser trusts the Certificate Authorities, and two of these Certificate Authorities were hacked by Iranian terrorists. These terrorists generated security certificates so that they could impersonate and eavesdrop on sites you know and love: Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo!, Google, Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Mozilla, and even the C.I.A. Over 250 511 sites in all are affected by this (and still counting).\nTo stay safe, browser makers (Mozilla, Microsoft, Google and Apple) have started issuing updates that revoke their trust for these hacked Certificate Authorities. As such, you need to make sure you’re running the very latest version of your web browser.\nHow do I stay safe? The best way to stay safe is to update your browser to the very latest version. If you’re not sure what browser you’re running, check out WhatBrowser.org.

        "plain":"Wayne Gretzky is often credited as being the single greatest hockey player of all time. It is said that his father, Walter Gretzky, taught him the most important thing to learn in hockey:\n “Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”\n This quote in particular is one that Steve Jobs has brought up on numerous occasions, and is far more revealing about Apple’s internal culture than I think most of us realize. It is certainly the most salient explanation for Apple’s intense focus at the intersection of technology and liberal arts.\n  Mobile Over the past couple of years, I’ve started paying an increasing amount of attention to Apple and it’s competition — mostly in the mobile space. Before 2008 when I bought my first iPhone, I really couldn’t have cared less about mobile. I’d had a couple of feature phones, then moved up to a BlackBerry Pearl in 2006. When Steve Jobs got up on stage at the Moscone Center in January 2007 and introduced “[…] an iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… these are NOT three separate devices!” I was stunned. I’d heard the rumors about an alleged phone from Apple, but this thing was simply astounding! Over the next 6 months, the blogosphere worked itself into an absolute frenzy over the iPhone. Ultimately, the iPhone has gone on to be a raging success — raking in two-thirds of all of the profits in the entire mobile industry.\nHardware and software Since Apple makes both the hardware and the software for all of their products, when you buy an iPhone (or iPod, or iPad, or Mac) you know that the hardware and software work together seamlessly. With the exception of HP/Palm ([up until recently](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=touchpad discontinued) and RIM, Apple is the only company that does this. Even Google’s Nexus line of phones is actually made by third-party handset makers (HTC for the Nexus One and Samsung for the Nexus S). In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\nHardware Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  BlackBerry 8800 Research In Motion     Q Motorola     E70 Nokia     Excalibur HTC     Touch HTC     Treo 755p Palm     Treo 700wx Palm    Software Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  Palm OS 5 PalmSoft     Windows Mobile 6 Microsoft     Symbian OS Nokia     Android Google    Queue the industry scramble People in the mobile industry knew this was going to be big, huge, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next iPhone-killer. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first touchphones started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had all of the same features, so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\nThere is no tablet market — only an iPad market Verne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of The New York Times note:\n “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n Here’s what John Gruber from Daring Fireball had to say:\n “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n And Marco Arment:\n \u0026ldquo;There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t nothing, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\u0026rdquo;\n Others are saying the same thing. But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\nIt’s the ecosystem, stupid! The fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n  Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n  Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n  The iTunes Store has over 18 million songs; thousands of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 virus-free apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n  iTunes Home Sharing allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n  AirPlay (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an AirPort Express or support the AirPlay protocol.\n  You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an Apple TV also using AirPlay.\n  You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n  Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n  Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n  Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n  Compare all of this to, say, Android.\n  First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n  Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n  There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has Google Music, but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n  Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe”, “Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says”, “Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them”, and “Warning: Fake games in the Market today”.\n  There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n  There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n  There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n  What Android cottage industry?\n  Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n  Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a small subset of devices based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n  Apple’s Strategy Apple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about the digital hub dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their Rip, Mix, Burn campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n iTunes (2001) Mac OS X (2001) Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001) iPod (2001) Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002) iTunes Music Store (2003) AirPort Express (2004) iLife (2004) Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005) Apple TV (2007) iPhone (2007) iPhone Music Store (2007) iPhone App Store (2008) iPad (2010) iCloud (2011)  All of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\nSkating to where the puck has been Right now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. Everyone.\n  Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n  Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n  Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n  Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n  As technophiliacs, it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. For example, Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices. Really Samsung? In \u0026ldquo;Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong\u0026rdquo;, Zach Epstein writes:\n \u0026ldquo;Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy. The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\u0026rdquo;\n These products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\nSkating to where the puck is going to be Robert S. Andersen recently tweeted:\n Apple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is delightful. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip:\n Harriet: I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\nMatt: That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\nHarriet: What did I do wrong?\nMatt: You asked for the laugh.\nHarriet: What did I do at the table read?\nMatt: You asked for the butter.\n If you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\nUpdate: HP Envy (2011–11–16 ) If I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new HP Envy.\n  I feel like I’ve seen this somewhere before…\nUpdate: Fun with numbers! (2011–11–24 ) In his piece entitled “Fun With Numbers”, John Gruber from Daring Fireball analyzes an NPD Group report about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., real sales numbers to consumers, not the fake we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them numbers).\n That’s one way to put it. Another way is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely considered an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, none of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011. […] PC manufacturers are not dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem — hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals — are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n He finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n ",

Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\"\n\n[Others]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20110620/consumers-dont-want-tablets-they-want-ipads/\" %}}) [are]({{% wayback \"http://seekingalpha.com/article/289447-there-is-no-tablet-market-only-an-ipad-market\" %}}) [saying]({{% wayback \"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/tablet-computers\" %}}) [the]({{% wayback \"http://technologizer.com/2011/08/17/more-evidence-that-theres-no-tablet-market/\" %}}) [same]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/ipad_dominance\" %}}) [thing]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}}). But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\n\n## It’s the ecosystem, stupid!\n\nThe fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I [wrote a couple of weeks ago](/2011/08/21/comparing-the-hp-touchpad-to-the-ipad-2/), I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\n\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n\n* Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n\n* Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n\n* The iTunes Store has [over 18 million songs]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/\" %}}); [thousands]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/itunes.html\" %}}) of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 *virus-free* apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n\n* [iTunes Home Sharing]({{% wayback \"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3819\" %}}) allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n\n* [AirPlay]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/\" %}}) (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an [AirPort Express]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/\" %}}) or support the AirPlay protocol.\n\n* You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an [Apple TV]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/appletv/\" %}}) also using [AirPlay]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/appletv/#remote\" %}}).\n\n* You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n\n* Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n\n* Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n\n* Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on [all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" %}}) (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n\nCompare all of this to, say, Android.\n\n* First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n\n* Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n\n* There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has [Google Music]({{% wayback \"http://music.google.com\" %}}), but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n\n* Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “[Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe]({{% wayback \"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/08/android-malware-explodes-ios-remains-safe/all/1\" %}})”, “[Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/24/android-targeted-malware-jumps-76-in-q2-mcafee-says/\" %}})”, “[Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them]({{% wayback \"http://www.technobuffalo.com/companies/google/android/why-android-viruses-are-growing-and-how-to-stop-them/\" %}})”, and “[Warning: Fake games in the Market today]({{% wayback \"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kjywq/warning_fake_games_in_the_market_today/\" %}})”.\n\n* There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n\n* There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n\n* There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n\n* What Android cottage industry?\n\n* Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n\n* Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a [small subset of devices]({{% wayback \"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient\" %}}) based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n\n## Apple’s Strategy\n\nApple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about *the digital hub* dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their [Rip, Mix, Burn]({{% wayback \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECN4ZE9-Mo\" %}}) campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n\n1. iTunes (2001)\n2. Mac OS X (2001)\n3. Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001)\n4. iPod (2001)\n5. Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002)\n6. iTunes Music Store (2003)\n7. AirPort Express (2004)\n8. iLife (2004)\n9. Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005)\n10. Apple TV (2007)\n11. iPhone (2007)\n12. iPhone Music Store (2007)\n13. iPhone App Store (2008)\n14. iPad (2010)\n15. iCloud (2011)\n\nAll of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\n\n## Skating to where the puck has been\n\nRight now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. *Everyone.*\n\n* Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n\n* Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n\n* Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n\n* Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n\nAs [technophiliacs]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Technophilia\" %}}), it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to *throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.* For example, [Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/109241074429603840\" %}}). Really Samsung? In \"[Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}})\", Zach Epstein writes:\n\n\u003e \"Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: *slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy.* The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\"\n\nThese products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\n\n## Skating to where the puck is going to be\n\nRobert S. Andersen recently [tweeted]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/rsa/status/106977599183527936\" %}}):\n\n{{\u003c tweet 106977599183527936 \u003e}}\n\nApple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is *delightful*. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\n\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, [Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip\" %}}):\n\n\u003e **Harriet:** I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\n\u003e\n\u003e **Matt:** That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do wrong?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the laugh.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do at the table read?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the butter.\n\nIf you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\n\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\n\n## Update: HP Envy ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–16\"\u003e}})\n\nIf I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new [HP Envy]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/16/2564285/hp-envy-15-and-17-press-photos\" %}}).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hp-envy.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nI feel like I’ve [seen this somewhere before]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/\" %}})…\n\n## Update: Fun with numbers! ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–24\"\u003e}})\n\nIn his piece entitled “[Fun With Numbers]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers\" %}})”, John Gruber from *Daring Fireball* analyzes an [NPD Group report]({{% wayback \"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b\" %}}) about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., *real* sales numbers to consumers, not the fake *we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them* numbers).\n\n\u003e That’s one way to put it. [Another way]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/139517109439959040\" %}}) is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely *considered* an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, *none* of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011. \\[…\\] PC manufacturers are *not* dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem — hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals — are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n\nHe finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n\n\u003e The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n"},

When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides.

        "plain":"I currently own and love my iPad 2, but with HP slashing the prices on the new TouchPads this weekend, I decided to pick one up after calling around and finding some at my local Best Buy.   Preface I feel that I should start by saying that I’m an Apple guy; or more specifically that I’ve always been an Apple guy. I was converted to the Mac platform back in the early 90’s when my Junior High school’s library got a new shipment of Apple Macintosh LC IIs. I’ve never really looked back.\nThat said, this certainly isn’t a blind love for Apple. Over the years, Apple has earned my trust by providing high-quality products, software and support that puts the consumer first. That doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ve liked every single decicion they’ve made, but all-in-all I have Apple’s back because I believe that Apple has mine.\nLet’s look at the competition:\n  RIM: RIM is dead. Sell your stock.\n  Microsoft: Irrelevant in this day and age.\n  Google:\n  They’d screw me in a second if they could sell more data about me to advertisers.\n  Google values engineering above all else. Unfortunately for Google, Design is more important than Engineering.\n  Andy Rubin has as much dumb stuff come out of his mouth as Steve Ballmer.\n  Google recently kicked off a whine-fest because they lost a patent auction.\n    Palm: CEO was a high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod. Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n  Piqued Interest I have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s Windows CE, palm-sized PC, PocketPC, Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition, Windows Mobile, Windows Embedded Handheld, Windows Phone 7 Series, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called The Paradox of Choice (TED video) (Wikipedia summary). The short version is that while people like Steve Ballmer and Andy Rubin are all touting how wonderful it is to have a plethora of devices available, it’s actually harmful to the customer experience.\nSo when Palm/HP announced the TouchPad, I was intrigued. I’d always thought that Palm’s webOS was a clear stand-out among mobile OSs, but the faulty Pre hardware and a poor at-launch partner (Sprint), and terrible marketing all worked in concert to kill Palm’s chances of making a dent in the marketplace. Palm also was in the poor position of needing a serious influx of cash if they were to continue operating. That kind of split focus is never good for a company.\nSeeing some gorgeous screenshots of the OS and devices on Sebastiaan de With’s blog pretty much sealed the deal for me: I was a webOS fan. Unfortunately for Palm/HP, there was no way I was going to spend money on a TouchPad when I could get an iPad.\n  Comparing the TouchPad and the iPad 2 I ordered my iPad 2 at the end of July, so I’ve only had my iPad 2 for about 3 weeks. I also have an iPhone 4, so picking up and using an iPad was effortless. Because of this, the iPad has set an awfully high bar in my mind.\nAfter spending a little less than 24 hours with my new 32GB HP TouchPad, here are my thoughts:\nPros   Palm/HP definitely got the packaging right. It’s the most Apple-like experience for any non-Apple product I’ve ever seen.\n  webOS is gorgeous, with an emphasis on black/charcoal colors, the Prelude system font, and high-quality iconography derived from the circle shape (Palm owns the circle). If you believe (as I do) that a software environment should look as good as it works, webOS is fantastic.\n  The TouchPad hardware is nice to the eyes and the touch. It has a sturdy (although somewhat plastic-y) feel to it.\n  Neither Netflix nor Hulu are filtering the TouchPad’s user-agent string. Hulu seems to maintain a black list for devices (Hulu has to pro-actively block devices), while Netflix seems to maintain a white list for devices (Netflix has to pro-actively allow devices). While I can watch Hulu content on my TouchPad (which comes with Flash), I can’t watch Netflix content (which requires Silverlight).\n  The bezel/cards UI is awesome.\n  Built-in support for several third-party accounts, including Skype and Dropbox. While iOS (and Mac OS X Lion) also has this, webOS’s integration seems to go a lot deeper — specifically in being able to do a decent job of merging contacts together across the various services.\n  The Facebook app (developed by Palm) beats the pants off of the phone-only iOS Facebook app. The closest competitor available for the iPad is an app called MyPad+.\n  The Last.fm app is also designed for the TouchPad, easily beating the phone-only iOS Last.fm app.\n  The photo app has built-in support for Facebook photos and videos built right in.\n  The on-screen keyboard has digits as part of its first screen. You don’t need to tap shift to get to them.\n  Cons   It’s a lot heavier than my iPad 2.\n  The screen and iPhone 3G-ish style back attract fingerprints like its their job.\n  The UI doesn’t track finger movements as quickly as iOS, so the touch/scroll responsiveness feels laggy compared to the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.\n  Actually, the whole OS is a bit laggy. It’s as if it takes a moment to “spin-up” after I launch an application or switch from one screen to another.\n  The TouchPad uses a non-standard Mini-USB cable, so my cache of leftover cables from my BlackBerry Pearl days are still as useless to me as they’ve been since I upgraded to the iPhone.\n  It doesn’t seem to charge when connected to my computer, so I need to disconnect it, climb down underneath my desk, and plug it in to get it to charge.\n  Ever heard of BeatsAudio? It’s the technology that powers the Beats by Dre headphone that are so freaking awesome. Yeah, not feeling it here. The iPad 2 speakers are better.\n  The app selection is downright awful. All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Twitter, Instapaper, Flipboard are nowhere to be found on the HP App Catalog.\n  While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n  Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is much slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the Browserscope test suite for the past couple of hours and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n  The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see Mail). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n  Syncing sucks. Even with the HP Play software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n  Conclusion All-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n  I think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer (early 2011 MacBook Pro), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire store catalog.\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s Nintendo DSs when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of New Super Mario Bros. and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\nEpilogue: Side-by-side Photos In this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n  Here they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n  Here is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n  (Photo credits: First photo by HP/Palm. Second and third photos by Sebastiaan de With. Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\nUpdate: Micro-USB (2011–08–25 ) Thanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size du jour called Micro USB. The TouchPad uses the Micro-B flavor, which is why my Mini USB cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\nUpdate: Hulu (2011–08–25 ) Over the past couple of days, Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist. Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n  Update: Preware (2011–08–25 ) Last night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered Preware. Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like Cydia and Rock Your Phone for jailbroken iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually quite OK with this community).\n  As part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \u0026ldquo;Got a slow HP TouchPad?

There are a few others you can install to just make life a little simpler as well. I chose to install the following patches:\n Advanced Reset Options Faster Card Animations HYPER Version Increase Touch Sensitivity and Smoothness 10 Just Charge By Default Muffle System Logging Private Browsing Remove Tap Ripple Unthrottle Download Manager  That last one is interesting. I had wondered why downloads seemed so slow on the TouchPad compared to my iOS devices. As it turns out, webOS throttles download speeds down to 64 kbps. Applying the patch to unthrottle the download manager sped up my TouchPad downloads dramatically.\n  ",

All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., [Netflix]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" %}}), [Hulu]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hulu-plus/id376510438\" %}}), [Twitter]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271\" %}}), [Instapaper]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208\" %}}), [Flipboard]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284\" %}}) are nowhere to be found on the [HP App Catalog]({{% wayback \"http://h41112.www4.hp.com/promo/webos/us/en/apps.html\" %}}).\n\n* While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n\n* Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is *much* slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the [Browserscope]({{% wayback \"http://browserscope.org\" %}}) test suite for the past couple of *hours* and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n\n* The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see [Mail]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/mail.html\" %}})). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n\n* Syncing sucks. Even with the [HP Play]({{% wayback \"http://hpplay.com\" %}}) software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TouchPad.png\"\u003e}}\n\nI think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer ([early 2011 MacBook Pro]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/stats/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\" %}})), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire ~~store~~ catalog.\n\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\n\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s [Nintendo DSs]({{% wayback \"http://www.nintendo.com/ds\" %}}) when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of [New Super Mario Bros.]({{% wayback \"http://mario.nintendo.com\" %}}) and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\n\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\n\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\n\n## Epilogue: Side-by-side Photos\n\nIn this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6074944167_fdb72ba8c9_z.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\nHere they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6075483254_7426a943d9.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\nHere is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6074943945_f33605a463.jpg\" alt=\"iPad 2 vs. HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\n(Photo credits: First photo by [HP/Palm]({{% wayback \"http://hpwebos.com\" %}}).

Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\n\n## Update: Micro-USB ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nThanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size *du jour* called [Micro USB]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/USB#Mini_and_Micro_connectors\" %}}). The TouchPad uses the *Micro-B* flavor, which is why my *Mini USB* cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\n\n## Update: Hulu ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nOver the past couple of days, [Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist]({{% wayback \"http://www.precentral.net/hulu-finally-blocks-touchpad-owners-watching-videos\" %}}). Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080274516_8044d5f9ab.jpg\" alt=\"Hulu blocks HP TouchPad\"\u003e}}\n\n## Update: Preware ({{\u003cdate \"2011–08–25\"\u003e}})\n\nLast night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered [Preware]({{% wayback \"http://preware.org\" %}}). Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like [Cydia]({{% wayback \"http://cydia.saurik.com/\" %}}) and [Rock Your Phone]({{% wayback \"http://rockyourphone.com\" %}}) for [jailbroken]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking\" %}}) iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually [quite OK]({{% wayback \"https://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=org.preware.docs\" %}}) with this community).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080468630_62f02c07f3.jpg\" alt=\"Preware\"\u003e}}\n\nAs part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \"[Got a slow HP TouchPad? Here are 3 easy ways to speed it up.]({{% wayback \"http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/got-a-slow-hp-touchpad-here-are-3-easy-ways-to-speed-it-up/\" %}})\" The first thing you learn is that webOS does a ton of logging in the background. While potentially useful for debugging, it also uses up a tremendous amount of system resources. The article discusses how to turn it off by enabling developer mode, installing Preware, and then installing a homebrew package that disables the logging. Also, if you’re interested in squeezing even more juice out of your TouchPad, the article also discusses how to overclock your TouchPad from 1.2 GHz to 1.5 GHz.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6079931607_b4aeaf598f.jpg\" alt=\"Govnah\"\u003e}}\n\nAnother article by John Biehler entitled \"[How to install Preware onto your HP TouchPad on a Mac]({{% wayback \"http://johnbiehler.com/2011/07/22/how-to-install-preware-onto-your-hp-touchpad-on-a-mac/\" %}})\" suggests a few other packages you can install to improve the general responsiveness of webOS on the TouchPad. There are a few others you can install to just make life a little simpler as well. I chose to install the following patches:\n\n* Advanced Reset Options\n* Faster Card Animations HYPER Version\n* Increase Touch Sensitivity and Smoothness 10\n* Just Charge By Default\n* Muffle System Logging\n* Private Browsing\n* Remove Tap Ripple\n* Unthrottle Download Manager\n\nThat last one is interesting. I had wondered why downloads seemed so slow on the TouchPad compared to my iOS devices. As it turns out, webOS throttles download speeds down to 64 kbps. Applying the patch to unthrottle the download manager sped up my TouchPad downloads *dramatically*.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6080468320_835506aa1e.jpg\" alt=\"Speed Test\"\u003e}}\n"},

I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you.

        "plain":"Over my career, my job title has typically fallen into one of two baskets: Front-End Web Developer or Software Engineer. I’ve done a lot of interviewing over the past several years to try and find the right people to join the teams I’ve worked on, and I thought it might be helpful to share part of my process. NOTE: I want to start by stating that what is written here are my own thoughts, and not representative of any past or current employer.\n Start Typically the process starts with an in-house recruiter sending a stack of résumés to my manager. My managers have usually taken a swag at filtering out the ones that are clearly junk, and then pass them off to me to make a determination as to whether someone is worth a phone call for the position.\nNow, I’m going to start by saying that my approach to résumés is greatly influenced by \u0026ldquo;A Glimpse and a Hook\u0026rdquo; and the follow-up, \u0026ldquo;A Brief Glimpse\u0026rdquo;. Like the author, I update my résumé every 3–6 months whether I’m looking for a new gig or not.\nYour Name I’ve been around. You might call me an Internet slut. If you’ve done something notable on the Front-End/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP front, I’ve probably heard of you. That’s already going to be a plus.\nAddress and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub I don’t need to know where you live. I don’t care. I’m not going to mail you a letter. An email address is good at the very least. Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\nHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live on the Internet. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/SourceForge/Google Code account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\nNot having these — as a Web or PHP developer — is a red flag for me. I wouldn’t necessarily expect someone with a Java or .NET background to use Twitter or GitHub (nothing against Java or .NET developers). But if you’re working in PHP, Ruby or the front-end, I expect to see these things otherwise I’m going to suspect that you’re out of touch with what’s happening right now.\nObjective If you have this on your résumé, get rid of it. It sucks. It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\n “To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\n Well, no shit.\nElevator Pitch Your elevator pitch should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph. Assume that this is the only part of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\nIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is Noah Stokes’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick Google, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\nAlternatively, I’m also a fan of the 1-pager. I first came across this concept through my colleague Christen Dybenko, who in-turn got the idea from a post by David Seah. This idea has also been made popular by sites like CV Parade. It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for. It isn’t a résumé replacement, but it’s a good way for you to hook my interest.\nSome sites make this easy for you; About.me and Zerply come immediately to mind.\nSkills and Software Skills are more important than software. I care more about you being able to do something than I do about the tools you use to get there.\nBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\n “Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\n Bullshit.\nI recommend breaking your skills down into three groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n  1–3: You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time.\n  4–6: You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n  7–9: You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n  10: You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n  Most people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\nIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like find, grep, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\nAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\nSummary of Qualifications I think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n Similar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\nUnlike Skills, which I find to be a total waste of time, I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking. When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n Most of the time, it’s a bunch of junk that doesn’t tell me anything. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \u0026ldquo;I work too hard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;My work is too perfect\u0026rdquo;, I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\nMe? I have a strong personality and sometimes I steamroll over people if I’m not paying attention. If the team I’m applying for is comprised primarily of easy-going and/or delicate personalities, I probably won’t be a good fit for your team. But if you’re looking for someone who has the backbone to make a decision and commit, and have other people on the team with strong personalities who like to hash out ideas to find the best ones, then I’m likely a great fit.\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\nWork Experience This is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n  I want to see what you accomplished (or where your focus was), what you learned, and how you’ve grown.\n  How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n  At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n  Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n  If you list an accomlishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n  Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n  Now, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\nReferences and Recommendations References have gone the way of the dodo bird. The thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\nNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light.

But understand that you’re in the minority.\nOther Tips Here are a few other things to think about:\nGitHub \u0026gt; Résumé: A GitHub account is better than a résumé. I’ll learn more from looking at your code and the kinds of things you like to work on than I ever will by looking over your résumé.\nHave some skin in the game: I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work.

My managers have usually taken a swag at filtering out the ones that are clearly junk, and then pass them off to me to make a determination as to whether someone is worth a phone call for the position.\n\nNow, I’m going to start by saying that my approach to résumés is greatly influenced by \"[A Glimpse and a Hook]({{% wayback \"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html\" %}})\" and the follow-up, \"[A Brief Glimpse]({{% wayback \"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/12/06/a_brief_glimpse.html\" %}})\". Like the author, I update my résumé every 3–6 months whether I’m looking for a new gig or not.\n\n## Your Name\n\nI’ve been around. You might call me an Internet slut. If you’ve done something notable on the Front-End/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP front, I’ve probably heard of you. That’s already going to be a plus.\n\n## Address and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub\n\nI don’t need to know where you live. I don’t care. I’m not going to mail you a letter. An email address is good *at the very least*. Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\n\nHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live *on the Internet*. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/SourceForge/Google Code account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\n\nNot having these — as a Web or PHP developer — is a red flag for me. I wouldn’t necessarily expect someone with a Java or .NET background to use Twitter or GitHub (nothing against Java or .NET developers). But if you’re working in PHP, Ruby or the front-end, I expect to see these things otherwise I’m going to suspect that you’re out of touch with what’s happening *right now*.\n\n## Objective\n\nIf you have this on your résumé, get rid of it. It sucks. It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\n\n\u003e “To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\n\nWell, no shit.\n\n## Elevator Pitch\n\nYour [elevator pitch]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch\" %}}) should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph. Assume that this is the only part of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\n\nIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is [Noah Stokes]({{% wayback \"http://noahstokes.com/hot-as-the-sun.php\" %}})’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick Google, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\n\nAlternatively, I’m also a fan of the **1-pager**. I first came across this concept through my colleague [Christen Dybenko]({{% wayback \"http://christen.dybenko.net\" %}}), who in-turn got the idea from a post by [David Seah]({{% wayback \"http://davidseah.com/blog/2008/07/powerpoint-resume-layout-tips/\" %}}). This idea has also been made popular by sites like [CV Parade]({{% wayback \"http://cvparade.com\" %}}). It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for. It isn’t a résumé replacement, but it’s a good way for you to hook my interest.\n\nSome sites make this easy for you; [About.me]({{% wayback \"http://about.me/skyzyx\" %}}) and [Zerply]({{% wayback \"http://zerp.ly/rparman\" %}}) come immediately to mind.\n\n## Skills and Software\n\nSkills are more important than software. I care more about you being able to do something than I do about the tools you use to get there.\n\nBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\n\n\u003e “Java, JavaScript, C\\#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\n\nBullshit.\n\nI recommend breaking your skills down into three groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n\n* **1–3:** You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time.\n\n* **4–6:** You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n\n* **7–9:** You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n\n* **10:** You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n\nMost people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\n\nIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like `find`, `grep`, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\n\nAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\n\n## Summary of Qualifications\n\nI think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n\n\u003e Similar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\n\u003e\n\u003e Unlike Skills, which I find to be a total waste of time, I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking. When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n\nMost of the time, it’s a bunch of junk that doesn’t tell me anything. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\n\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \"I work *too* hard\" or \"My work is *too* perfect\", I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\n\nMe? I have a strong personality and sometimes I steamroll over people if I’m not paying attention. If the team I’m applying for is comprised primarily of easy-going and/or *delicate* personalities, I probably won’t be a good fit for your team. But if you’re looking for someone who has the backbone to make a decision and commit, and have other people on the team with strong personalities who like to hash out ideas to find the best ones, then I’m likely a great fit.\n\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\n\n## Work Experience\n\nThis is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n\n* I want to see what you *accomplished* (or where your *focus* was), what you *learned*, and how you’ve *grown*.\n\n* How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n\n* At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n\n* Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n\n* If you list an accomlishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n\n* Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n\nNow, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\n\n## References and Recommendations\n\nReferences have gone the way of the dodo bird. The thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\n\nNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light. In that way, a lot of recommendations are junk. Knowing that, I’m less concerned about positive or negative spin and more concerned with *what* they write about you? What language do they use? How well does it seem like they know you, and what kinds of things do they bring up about you? Do I see a recurring theme throughout all of your recommendations? How well do they mesh with how you’ve described yourself?\n\n## Education\n\nGenerally, I completely skip this section. The only thing I check for is whether or not you have a Master’s degree. What my personal experience has taught me is that a Master’s degree means very little real-world experience, and the experience that they *do* have is generally pretty useless.\n\nNow, if you have your Master’s degree *and* know your stuff, then that’s great. But understand that you’re in the minority.\n\n## Other Tips\n\nHere are a few other things to think about:\n\n**GitHub \u0026gt; Résumé:** A GitHub account is better than a résumé. I’ll learn more from looking at your code and the kinds of things you like to work on than I ever will by looking over your résumé.\n\n**Have some skin in the game:** I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work. They knew *my reputation* before they knew *me*. A huge bonus is if you’re already doing the thing that I’m trying to hire for.\n\n**Sound like a human being:** If you say “planned, designed, and coordinated engineers efforts for the development of a mission critical system”, you sound like a jargon machine more than a human being. Only write stuff that will actually tell me something about you. No mumbo-jumbo.\n\n**Spelling and Grammar:** If you misspell something or have generally poor grammar, I’m going to move on. Sorry. This especially applies to the following areas:\n\n* Their, there, and they’re\n* Then and than\n* Lose and loose\n* And brand/product names: “I-phone” is very, very wrong.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNow, I know that I don’t speak for everybody. Some people take a very different approach to reviewing résumés, and that’s fine. It’s also possible that I’m not the kind of person that you’d like to work with/for, and that’s fine too.\n\nI know that facets of my approach are used by people that I consider some of the best in the industry, and as such I’ve tried to learn from the best ideas I’ve come across to make the most informed decisions possible when determining whether or not to schedule the next step (i.e., the phone interview).\n\nIf you’re involved in creating things for the web, take heed to my suggestions. Even if you don’t follow all of them, definitely make it a point to raise the quality of your résumé.\n"},

Four and a half years later, the company has just recently launched something that I’d consider \u003cem\u003epre-alpha\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’m no longer with the company, I truly wish the remaining team the absolute best. We had some groundbreaking and innovative ideas, and I hope that a real, viable product will emerge soon. Thomas Edison — inventor of the lightbulb — once said “I’ve never failed. I’ve simply found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” Up until today, WarpShare has been — by nearly all definitions — a business failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn’t mean that it will continue to be a business failure, only that the team hasn’t yet gotten to where we/they need to be, even after four-\u003cem\u003esomeodd\u003c/em\u003e years. Starting and running an early-stage company has been simultaneously the greatest and worst experience of my entire life, besides raising my children, of course. Here are some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-business-plan-doesnt-matter\"\u003eYour business plan doesn’t matter.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t. At all. It doesn’t matter because it’s all going to change. Tomorrow you’ll realize that somebody else is doing a better version of your idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, you might realize that this teeny-tiny idea you have is actually much bigger than you’d originally thought, and you’ll need to adjust everything to take the modified idea into account. Perhaps you expect it to change. Perhaps you know it’s not perfect. Great, because at least your either honest or smart enough to know that. Having a business plan written down isn’t bad; just make sure that you treat it as a rough draft at all times. It’s not final, and it never will be. If it is final, then you’re either the very smartest or very dumbest entrepreneur in the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re planning to go for a venture capital (“VC”) round, know that VCs don’t care about the plan — they care about your team. Rather, they need to believe in your team’s ability to execute a great idea. If you don’t believe in either your team or the idea, VCs will sniff that out and you’ll get nowhere with them. If a VC firm has never heard of you before, you’re less likely to get funded. That’s the long and the short of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"choose-your-business-partners-like-you-would-choose-your-spouse\"\u003eChoose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just \u003cem\u003eroll over\u003c/em\u003e. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-good-investor-meeting-means-nothing-if-they-dont-write-a-check\"\u003eA good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dont-get-starry-eyes-just-yet\"\u003eDon’t get starry eyes just yet.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or \u003cem\u003e[insert awe-inspiring startup here]\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months.

You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product.

        "plain":"In July 2006, I co-founded a startup along with three of the smartest guys I’ve ever met. Four and a half years later, the company has just recently launched something that I’d consider pre-alpha.\nAlthough I’m no longer with the company, I truly wish the remaining team the absolute best. We had some groundbreaking and innovative ideas, and I hope that a real, viable product will emerge soon. Thomas Edison — inventor of the lightbulb — once said “I’ve never failed. I’ve simply found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” Up until today, WarpShare has been — by nearly all definitions — a business failure.\nThat doesn’t mean that it will continue to be a business failure, only that the team hasn’t yet gotten to where we/they need to be, even after four-someodd years. Starting and running an early-stage company has been simultaneously the greatest and worst experience of my entire life, besides raising my children, of course. Here are some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.\nYour business plan doesn’t matter. It doesn’t. At all. It doesn’t matter because it’s all going to change. Tomorrow you’ll realize that somebody else is doing a better version of your idea.\nOn the other hand, you might realize that this teeny-tiny idea you have is actually much bigger than you’d originally thought, and you’ll need to adjust everything to take the modified idea into account. Perhaps you expect it to change. Perhaps you know it’s not perfect. Great, because at least your either honest or smart enough to know that. Having a business plan written down isn’t bad; just make sure that you treat it as a rough draft at all times. It’s not final, and it never will be. If it is final, then you’re either the very smartest or very dumbest entrepreneur in the entire world.\nIf you’re planning to go for a venture capital (“VC”) round, know that VCs don’t care about the plan — they care about your team. Rather, they need to believe in your team’s ability to execute a great idea. If you don’t believe in either your team or the idea, VCs will sniff that out and you’ll get nowhere with them. If a VC firm has never heard of you before, you’re less likely to get funded. That’s the long and the short of it.\nIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\nChoose your business partners like you would choose your spouse. You wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\nFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\nSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\nFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\n  We had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\n  We were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\n  We were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just roll over. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\n  We all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\n  A good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check. During the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\nTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\nDon’t get starry eyes just yet. “This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or [insert awe-inspiring startup here].\nMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months. She was a loan officer for Washington Mutual Bank and was suddenly having a tough time closing deals (Washington Mutual ended up getting eaten alive during the real estate crash, and its assets were handed over to J.P. Morgan Chase). Since our startup was sure to be wildly successful in the next few months, she decided to go back to school.\nInstead the opposite happened. The housing market tanked and took the investment community down with it. Thousands of companies started shedding employees by the ton. My wife was laid-off and pretty much all of our investment deals fell through — all at the same time. It was the perfect storm.\nWe went from making $150,000 a year to having no income at all, within only a few months. We liquidated all of our assets and maxed out all of our credit cards to try and stay afloat just a little longer. “We did have that good investor meeting, after all. Maybe they’ll write us a check next week.” While work ethic, determination and perseverance are valuable traits for a startup founder, starry eyes will only deceive you. If you’re successful, you could end up being an accidental billionaire. If not, you could end up being financially ruined.\nIt will take a toll on your family. While we started out with four co-founders, one of them was only there to help us get started and offer his network of connections to us. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in the end, there were three of us who were fully invested in making this thing go.\nThey say that startup founders experience really high “highs” and really low “lows.” This is the truest statement I’ve ever heard with regard to startup life. But when you found a new startup immediately before the whole country goes into a massive recession, you encounter far more lows than you do highs. Of the three of us, two of us ended up divorced.

I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\nShipping is your most valuable feature. It doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Let me say that again: If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Rands once said “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\n Gotten together your initial team. Burned through some cash. Done a ton of planning. Done a ton of coding. Argued with your team about the right thing to build. A ton of other stuff.  You want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\nSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding.

That’s the long and the short of it.\n\nIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\n\n## Choose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\n\nYou wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\n\nFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\n\nSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\n\nFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\n\n1. We had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\n\n2. We were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\n\n3. We were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just *roll over*. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\n\n4. We all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\n\n## A good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check.\n\nDuring the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\n\nTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\n\n## Don’t get starry eyes just yet.\n\n“This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or *\\[insert awe-inspiring startup here\\]*.\n\nMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months. She was a loan officer for Washington Mutual Bank and was suddenly having a tough time closing deals (Washington Mutual ended up [getting eaten alive during the real estate crash, and its assets were handed over to J.P. Morgan Chase]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Washington_Mutual#Rise_and_fall\" %}})). Since our startup was *sure* to be wildly successful in the next few months, she decided to go back to school.\n\nInstead the opposite happened. The housing market tanked and took the investment community down with it. Thousands of companies started shedding employees by the ton. My wife was laid-off and pretty much all of our investment deals fell through — all at the same time. It was the perfect storm.\n\nWe went from making $150,000 a year to having no income at all, within only a few months. We liquidated all of our assets and maxed out all of our credit cards to try and stay afloat just a little longer. “We did have that good investor meeting, after all. Maybe they’ll write us a check next week.” While work ethic, determination and perseverance are valuable traits for a startup founder, starry eyes will only deceive you. If you’re successful, you could end up being an accidental billionaire. If not, you could end up being financially ruined.\n\n## It will take a toll on your family.\n\nWhile we started out with four co-founders, one of them was only there to help us get started and offer his network of connections to us. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in the end, there were three of us who were fully invested in making this thing go.\n\nThey say that startup founders experience really high “highs” and really low “lows.” This is the truest statement I’ve ever heard with regard to startup life. But when you found a new startup immediately before the whole country goes into a massive recession, you encounter far more lows than you do highs. Of the three of us, two of us ended up *divorced*. The one who didn’t was the bachelor of the group.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that every startup founder will go through this, and in our cases the startup was not the only factor in the equation, but it will definitely take a toll on you and your family. Plan on it. While I was going through a complete financial, marital and business meltdown in 2008, I would occasionally tweet obscure references to how I was feeling and what I was going through. I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\n\n## Shipping is your most valuable feature.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. *If you don’t ship, you have nothing.* Let me say that again: *If you don’t ship, you have nothing.* [Rands once said]({{% wayback \"http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/04/20/10.html\" %}}) “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\n\n1. Gotten together your initial team.\n2. Burned through some cash.\n3. Done a ton of planning.\n4. Done a ton of coding.\n5. Argued with your team about the right thing to build.\n6. A ton of other stuff.\n\nYou want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\n\nSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product. Once we figured out what the product would be, we tried to figure out what it looked like, how it would work, etc.\n\nBy this point, we were long-since out of cash. I’d taken on another daytime job to pay the bills. All-in-all, we burned a lot of time and a lot of cash just trying to figure out what the heck we were going to do. All along the way, we’d been trying to get VC funding so that we could feed our families and hire some people to help us make progress in narrowing our focus so that we could build something.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the VCs had ever heard of us before, and we didn’t have a product to show them yet. Finally, in May 2009 we restarted development in earnest. Over the next 10 months until I left to join Amazon Web Services, we were able to accomplish a lot considering how abysmally resource-constrained we were. The next time around, I plan to do a few things very differently.\n\n1. I won’t quit my daytime job until I believe that the idea is going to go somewhere.\n\n2. Focus on building the minimum viable product. In our case, we had to significantly narrow our scope so that we could figure out what to build first. We were all so excited about the future that we couldn’t figure out where to start.\n\n3. Your customers are not venture capitalists, so don’t make the mistake of trying to build something that you think VCs will fund. Instead, build something that *users will love*. VC money will follow the users. In our case, we didn’t have the resources to build something awesome for users, so we tried to build for VCs to get the money to build for our users. This strategy never worked for us, not even once, and in retrospect it was one of the **worst** ideas we ever had.\n\n4. Demo, don’t pitch. Again, VCs don’t care about pitches. If you’ve never done a successful startup before, then they’re not going to fund you anyway. If you don’t have something working that you can show them, don’t even bother setting up the meeting. Realistically, you need a working demo to pitch to angel investors. You need a live product with real users to pitch to VCs. If all that you show up with is a tie and a piece of paper talking about what your business plan is, you’ve just wasted the time of everybody in the room — including your own.\n\n## Perseverance is paramount.\n\nOnce you go all-in on your startup, you need to be truly all-in. If you want to succeed, you need to treat this project like a life-or-death situation. You need to believe that you will live or die by the success of what you’re working on. If you hedge your bet and leave yourself an out, you won’t make it. Paul Graham, a VC from YCombinator, [once said]({{% wayback \"http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they’ve become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that’s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can’t pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server. Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!\n\nThis is the one piece of advice that got me through so many of those dark, demoralizing days. Just keep typing.\n\n## Conclusion.\n\nWhile my own experience as a startup founder has thus far led to a business that hasn’t yet succeeded, it doesn’t mean that yours will end up the same way. Whether you’re trying to do an Internet startup like me, or simply trying to start a consulting business out of your home, all of the aforementioned points apply.\n\n1. Your business plan doesn’t matter. Doing something is what matters.\n\n2. Choose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\n\n3. If you’re looking for funding, only the check matters.\n\n4. Focus on what you can do here and now — not at some arbitrary point in the future.\n\n5. It can take a toll on your family. Families can’t go on autopilot. Take time away from work to spend with the people you love.\n\n6. If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Or (if you’re providing a service instead of a product) if you’re not currently providing the service, you have nothing.\n\n7. The only person who can make this thing go is you. It will be hard. It will be frustrating. Make it go anyway.\n\nFinally, while this is by no means an exhaustive list, I would recommend spending some quality time digesting the writing from the following authors:\n\n* [Paul Graham]({{% wayback \"http://paulgraham.com/articles.html\" %}})\n* [Michael Lopp (aka “Rands”)]({{% wayback \"http://randsinrepose.com\" %}})\n* [Seth Godin]({{% wayback \"http://sethgodin.typepad.com\" %}})\n* [John Maeda]({{% wayback \"http://lawsofsimplicity.com\" %}})\n\n"},

        "plain":"The Last Airbender is an abomination to film making. It makes Matrix Revolutions look like The Godfather. Don’t go see it, tell your friends not to see it — don’t even wait until it comes out on DVD. Don’t waste a moment of your life on this film; you’ll thank me later.   I love Avatar I am a huge fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender. When I was out of work for a few weeks in 2005, I happened to land on this Nickelodeon cartoon while channel surfing. The depth of the universe, the chemistry between the characters, and the fact that it had something for both kids and adults simply mesmerized me. I was astounded that the writing for an animated cartoon could be so good.\nOver the next few years, I watched Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko, Ihro, Appa and little Momo grow together as a family, and saw Aang grow from being the boy in the iceberg to a fully-realized master of all four elements. The build-up to the finale kept me on the edge of my seat, and the final battle between Avatar Aang and Fire Lord Ozai was simply epic! When the story ended, there was closure for all of the characters. Although I knew I was going to miss the show, I was happy that it ended on a high note.\nExpectations When I heard that M. Night Shyamalan was going to make a live-action Airbender film, I was both excited and worried. Very few re-makes have done their originals justice. Superman Returns, Spider-man, [The Incredible] Hulk, Transformers — I’m looking at you.\nYou guys weren’t very good, and I wasn’t expecting much from you. Notable exceptions are the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jurassic Park and the Harry Potter films. While not perfect, these re-makes did an admirable job at standing up on behalf of the source material. Even the Bourne trilogy, which notoriously deviated from the books, was at least a great set of movies.\n  Despite M. Night being pretty hit-or-miss over the last decade, I still considered myself a fan. Luke Y. Thompson, E! Online, described M. Night as:\n “Director M. Night Shyamalan is, of course, best known for slow-burn, low-key suspense films that end with dramatic twists.”\n If you’re familiar with Airbender, you’ll know that its story doesn’t fit the typical M. Night criteria. The Sixth Sense, Signs and The Village were all good flicks; Unbreakable and The Happening were so-so; Lady in the Water was unbearably boring. So which way was this re-make of one of my favorite TV shows going to go? Luke Thompson goes on to say:\n “And that probably makes him exactly the wrong person for a would-be epic like this adaptation of the popular animated serial Avatar: The Last Airbender.”\n Of course, I hadn’t read this review before I saw the movie. I did, however, see a quick quote from the Roger Ebert review:\n “The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. The laws of chance suggest that something should have gone right. Not here. It puts a nail in the coffin of low-rent 3D, but it will need a lot more coffins than that.”\n Sometimes Ebert is right; sometimes he’s wrong. I figured I’d take my chances. I was horribly, horribly wrong.\nStory and pacing Listed on IMDb as the sole screenwriter for the film, M. Night had the job of packing nearly 8 hours worth of source material into a 2 hour movie. But rather than pulling out the most interesting parts of the first season and trying to create a worthy film portrayal that was true to the characters and storyline, it seems that he opted for simply taking the entire season on DVD and pressing the fast-forward button on the remote.\nThe backstory is pretty much non-existent for much of the film. Some storytellers will introduce parts of the backstory through flash-backs; some will have the backstory come out as part of the natural progression of the characters so that the audience can figure out how we got here. The backstory was barely glossed over as exposition, and not even good exposition.\n  In the pilot episode, “The Boy in the Iceberg,” there is an extended intro where Katara narrates the backstory of how the 4 elemental nations lived in peace and harmony until the day the Fire Nation attacked. It tells of how the Avatar — master of all four elements — vanished 100 years ago, and in that time, most people came to believe that he was dead.\nAn episode or two later, we learn that the Avatar is re-incarnated into the next elemental nation in sequence — this time it was Aang, an Airbender. Before him was Avatar Roku, a Firebender. The film barely touches on these fundamentally key plot points, which leaves any semi-intelligent movie-goer somewhat confused by what’s going on.\nThe poor pacing of the movie made the whole story feel very jerky. The movie clocked in at an hour and forty minutes, culminating in a battle of good vs. evil at the Northern Water Tribe. The last 40 minutes were spent on what was essentially 4 out of 20 episodes worth of material.

Not only was he incredibly stiff and humorless throughout the film, but his inability to show any sort of emotion toward either his sister or the northern water princess provides nothing more than a devastatingly awkward and abysmal performance.\nQuotes Think I may be over-reacting? Here’s what others had to say:\n “After waiting extremely eagerly for this movie, I sat in the theater and was extremely eager for it to END. Ear-oh? Oong? Soak-ah?! Could they have butchered the names anymore than they did?

The last 40 minutes were spent on what was essentially 4 out of 20 episodes worth of material. Interesting and important plot points throughout were skipped, but as long as we got some awesome CG effects, that would make up for it, right? Wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, M. Night had done such a poor job of developing the characters and the backstory that I didn’t really care who won as long as I knew I would be out of my misery soon. 20 minutes from the end, I nearly fell asleep. Once the credits began to roll, I nearly tramped an old woman while trying to get out of the theater.\n\n## Characters\n\nI don’t believe that M. Night has seen a single episode of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. Okay, maybe one or two — but certainly not the entire series. If he had, he’d know that the most important element of the show was the characters and the relationships that they formed over 3 seasons. Neither the writing nor the actors provided an accurate portrayal of the characters we’ve come to know.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/airbender_characters.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Airbender\"\u003e}}\n\n*Aang* is a 12-year-old boy that is generally playful and fun. He cares very deeply for his friends, and would do anything for them. But Aang is also very reflective about his place in the world. Being the Avatar, he’s very respectful of his lineage, and spends a lot of time in self-discovery.\n\n*Sokka* is the comedy relief. He always knows the wrong thing to say at the wrong time, and is great at drawing the wrong conclusion from his experiences. Being the eldest, however, he carries a certain weight in wanting to protect his friends.\n\n*Katara* is motherly and nurturing, and has a certain insight and sensitivity that helps Aang along the way. When Sokka is telling bad jokes, and Aang is reflecting on what it means to be the Avatar, Katara is making sure that the bonds of their friendship stay strong.\n\n*Zuko*, the prince of the Fire Nation, is a tormented soul. Never able to earn the love and respect of his father, Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation by his father. The only way for Zuko to regain his honor is to capture the Avatar and bring him back home to the Fire Nation.\n\nThese are the characters of the *Airbender* universe. With the exception of [Dev Patel](https://letterboxd.com/actor/dev-patel/) who had a barely-adequate performance as Prince Zuko, the rest of the characters might as well have been made out of cotton balls and popsicle sticks. No chemistry, no character development, no emotion, and totally wrong character traits.\n\nIn particular, I felt that casting [Jackson Rathbone](https://letterboxd.com/actor/jackson-rathbone/) as Sokka was a huge mistake. Not only was he incredibly stiff and humorless throughout the film, but his inability to show any sort of emotion toward either his sister or the northern water princess provides nothing more than a devastatingly awkward and abysmal performance.\n\n## Quotes\n\nThink I may be over-reacting? Here’s what [others had to say]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/usercomments\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “After waiting extremely eagerly for this movie, I sat in the theater and was extremely eager for it to END. Ear-oh? Oong? Soak-ah?! Could they have butchered the names anymore than they did? Worse, the entire movie felt like a string of clips put together for an hour and a half and not like a movie at all.” — [Tamisura]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/user/ur5687195/comments\" %}})\n\n\u003e “So where did this movie go wrong? The better question would be: where didn’t it go wrong? The writing was horrendous. High school freshmen could probably manage to come up with a better screenplay. I’m not sure who gave Shyamalan permission to write this film, but whoever it was needs to formally apologize to the fans and to the people who wasted their money hoping to see something worthwhile.”— [LunaRaven]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/user/ur3794197/comments\" %}})\n\n\u003e “Void-ness of emotional moments are what really plague this film. I would blame this on the script but the performances are what make it not work. Every actor in this film (minus [Shaun Toub]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0869467/\" %}}) delivers dialogue as if they were reading it for the very first time. Not one thing anyone says carries any weight, none of it resonates emotionally. To say the actors suffer from wooden acting would be insult an to wood.” — [lukeg37]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/user/ur9399827/comments\" %}})\n\nAnd lastly, my favorite:\n\n\u003e “Just saw this, I don’t know what to call it. It was the only movie I’ve seen where everyone in the theater booed at the end and threw things at the screen. I feel like it was written by someone who can’t read, write or care about their or anyone else’s work. How do you take something that seemed like such a good idea and make it so terrible. I hope that the man or men responsible for this never get work again. This is what I would hope qualifies as a career killer, because I wish I had slept instead of going to this movie. I want my money, time, and expectations back. As in I expected at least good fun with the ‘bending’ or fight/dance scenes. I feel like I just got served… Do not watch or let ANYONE YOU KNOW GO TO THIS MOVIE, AND SOMEONE SHOULD PETITION TO CANCEL THE OTHER TWO.” — [Partofthevoid]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/user/ur3422378/comments\" %}})\n\nI’ll wrap things up with a quote from [Ty Burr]({{% wayback \"http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/06/30/airbender_loses_something_in_switch_from_cartoon_to_live_action/\" %}}), staff writer for the Boston Globe:\n\n\u003e “It would be heartening to report that Shyamalan has wrangled a good movie out of this litany of disaster, but no such luck. “The Last Airbender” is dreadful, an incomprehensible fantasy-action epic that makes the 2007 film “The Golden Compass”… look like a four-star classic.”\n\nM. Night Shyamalan was once one of my favorite writer-directors, but I’ve had enough. In the end I’ve decided to vote with my wallet. I’ll never pay to see another M. Night movie again.\n"},

(A side note is that they’ve never quite figured out how to use digital media sales to their advantage, and so they’re just shutting people down instead of working with them to find a more consumer-friendly solution. Acting out of fear is never good.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other major thing that the DMCA does is stops people (legally anyway) from bypassing or cracking something called DRM (“Digital Restriction Management”). DRM is the locking mechanism that stops you from downloading songs or videos from iTunes and putting them on your non-iPod player. It’s the locking mechanism that stops you from copying DVDs. A new kind of DRM known as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502062040/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System\"\u003eAACS\u003c/a\u003e is what locks the next-generation \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502062040/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-DVD\"\u003eHD-DVD\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070502062040/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluray\"\u003eBlu-ray\u003c/a\u003e movies/games so that you can’t copy them or back them up on your computer.

Naturally, this is illegal and the movie industry sent a cease-and-desist letter trying to get them to remove the key from public view. So be it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier — I’m assuming today — someone re-posted this key to Digg and the movie industry sent a cease-and-desist to have it removed. Digg complied. Someone else caught wind of this, and re-posted it. Digg removed that posting as well. After a bit of back and forth, the following was posted on the Digg blog this afternoon:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you agree or disagree with the policies of the intellectual property holders and consortiums, in order for Digg to survive, it must abide by the law. Digg’s Terms of Use, and the terms of use of most popular sites, are required by law to include policies against the infringement of intellectual property. This helps protect Digg from claims of infringement and being shut down due to the posting of infringing material by others. Our goal is always to maintain a purely democratic system for the submission and sharing of information - and we want Digg to continue to be a great resource for finding the best content. However, in order for that to happen, we all need to work together to protect Digg from exposure to lawsuits that could very quickly shut us down. Thanks for your understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of working together, the users of Digg began outright revolting. The AACS key was posted over and over and over again is a number of different ways. So much, in fact, that 98 of the last 100 stories to hit the front page of Digg are posts about that key. Digg has been banning posts and users all day long, and the users are fighting back with full force. Around 9:00pm PST, there was another post on the Digg blog that said the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was an insane day. And as the founder of Digg, I just wanted to post my thoughts… In building and shaping the site I’ve always tried to stay as hands on as possible. We’ve always given site moderation (digging/burying) power to the community. Occasionally we step in to remove stories that violate our terms of use (eg. linking to pornography, illegal downloads, racial hate sites, etc.). So today was a difficult day for us. We had to decide whether to remove stories containing a single code based on a cease and desist declaration. We had to make a call, and in our desire to avoid a scenario where Digg would be interrupted or shut down, we decided to comply and remove the stories with the code. But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, you’ve made it clear. You’d rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company. We hear you, and effective immediately we won’t delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be. If we lose, then what the hell, at least we died trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout an hour and a half later Digg went down. It’s been 45 minutes since then. I’m interested to see how this all shakes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Around 9:00pm PST, there was another post on the Digg blog that said the following:\n Today was an insane day.

We’ve always given site moderation (digging/burying) power to the community. Occasionally we step in to remove stories that violate our terms of use (eg. linking to pornography, illegal downloads, racial hate sites, etc.). So today was a difficult day for us. We had to decide whether to remove stories containing a single code based on a cease and desist declaration. We had to make a call, and in our desire to avoid a scenario where Digg would be interrupted or shut down, we decided to comply and remove the stories with the code. But now, after seeing hundreds of stories and reading thousands of comments, you’ve made it clear. You’d rather see Digg go down fighting than bow down to a bigger company. We hear you, and effective immediately we won’t delete stories or comments containing the code and will deal with whatever the consequences might be. If we lose, then what the hell, at least we died trying.\n About an hour and a half later Digg went down. It’s been 45 minutes since then. I’m interested to see how this all shakes out.\n",
        "source":"\n**Update:** See images of Digg’s homepage at [WordDissociation.com]({{% wayback \"http://www.worddissociation.com/2007/05/02/09-f9-11-02-9d-74-e3-5b-d8-41-56-c5-63-56-88-c0/\" %}}).\n\nI’ve been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to think of a good opening line, and I can’t. I’m speechless. Something very intriguing is happening this very moment: The users of [Digg]({{% wayback \"http://digg.com\" %}}) are outright _revolting_. This is the digital equivalent of the [Los Angeles riots]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_Riots\" %}}). But what’s more interesting is the fact that as of 9:00pm PST, Digg is *letting them*. (As I was writing this, Digg went down. This is getting more interesting by the minute…)\n\nIn the US, there is a law known as the [DMCA]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA\" %}}) — a heavily flawed and much hated law among consumers of digital media (including DVDs, HD-DVD \u0026 Blu-ray discs, and most downloadable songs and videos) that is often used by the Recording and Movie industries to justify suing people and shutting down services. (A side note is that they’ve never quite figured out how to use digital media sales to their advantage, and so they’re just shutting people down instead of working with them to find a more consumer-friendly solution. Acting out of fear is never good.)\n\nThe other major thing that the DMCA does is stops people (legally anyway) from bypassing or cracking something called DRM (“Digital Restriction Management”). DRM is the locking mechanism that stops you from downloading songs or videos from iTunes and putting them on your non-iPod player. It’s the locking mechanism that stops you from copying DVDs. A new kind of DRM known as [AACS]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System\" %}}) is what locks the next-generation [HD-DVD]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-DVD\" %}}) and [Blu-ray]({{% wayback \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluray\" %}}) movies/games so that you can’t copy them or back them up on your computer. (Sony’s Playstation 3 has a built-in Blu-ray player while Microsoft’s Xbox 360 has an optional HD-DVD player.)\n\nRecently, (and I’m trying to remember here) someone posted a code (known as a “key”) that allows programmers to build software that bypasses this locking mechanism allowing people to copy these next-generation DVDs. Naturally, this is illegal and the movie industry sent a cease-and-desist letter trying to get them to remove the key from public view. So be it.\n\nEarlier — I’m assuming today — someone re-posted this key to Digg and the movie industry sent a cease-and-desist to have it removed. Digg complied. Someone else caught wind of this, and re-posted it. Digg removed that posting as well. After a bit of back and forth, the following was posted on the Digg blog this afternoon:\n\n\u003e Whether you agree or disagree with the policies of the intellectual property holders and consortiums, in order for Digg to survive, it must abide by the law. Digg’s Terms of Use, and the terms of use of most popular sites, are required by law to include policies against the infringement of intellectual property. This helps protect Digg from claims of infringement and being shut down due to the posting of infringing material by others.
