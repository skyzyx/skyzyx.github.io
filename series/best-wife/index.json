It has built-in Wi-Fi, and the latest firmware update has a pretty decent web browser. Another friend got me \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20051227173319/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007TS24U/skyzyxcom-20\"\u003eGTA: Libery City Stories\u003c/a\u003e, although I haven’t had the chance to play it yet. I’m thinking about going out today and picking up \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20051227173319/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009VRSS2/skyzyxcom-20\"\u003eBurnout Legends\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20051227173319/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000AAZC08/skyzyxcom-20\"\u003eStar Wars: Battlefront II\u003c/a\u003e. Very cool stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what I didn’t know was that my new PSP wasn’t really my “big present”. It was just a decoy, of sorts. She hands me a wrapped DVD, which I promptly opened. Inside the DVD case, however, was a piece of paper with a riddle on it. I figured out that the riddle was another location in the house. I went there, and found another riddle. I couldn’t help but laugh, because I had done the same thing to her for her present — she just didn’t know it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I followed the clues to the back seat of her dad’s truck. I opened the door and saw a box that said “42-inch Plasma HD Widescreen”. I was completely dumbfounded. Based on the expression on my face, she thought that I was disappointed, but actually I was just trying to think of something to say. We got it all set up with the new Monster Cable that she’d gotten for it, and it was beautiful in all of it’s 42\u0026quot; Plasma glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the fourth season of “24” from my parents, so I spent the rest of the weekend watching 24 on my new TV with my already-owned Bose Surround Sound system. It’s like a movie theatre replacement, it’s so awesome! I felt kinda lame when she opened her new Palm T|X with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a 1GB SD Flash memory card, and a palmOne-branded GPS locator system for her Palm. But all-in-all, it was actually better that we got to spend so much time with our friends and family over this holiday season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love my kids, my wife (awesome toy-buyer extraordinaire), my friends that I got to spend a good deal of time with, and those that I consider my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
