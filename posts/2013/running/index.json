I started drinking a ton of water — so much that I was peeing 5–6 times a day. I started doing protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, then cooking something reasonably healthy for dinner. It was pretty easy because my wife and I were doing it together, and we were both working at home full-time. By May 2008, I was down to 180 lbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the housing market collapsed, taking out the economy and our jobs.

I ended up finding a job 150 miles away in Redwood City, CA and began commuting again. More stress, less energy, more snacks, more caffeine, less water.

Free snacks and goodies as long as you sat in a chair longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a few weeks, I was back up to 190 lbs.

So much candy was sitting around the house for a month after Halloween that it had to be eaten. Thanksgiving was delicious, and who doesn’t love leftovers for the couple of weeks afterward?
