Definitely: Next-gen iPhone 5S, iOS 7, OS X Mavericks, iTunes 11 (with iTunes Radio), updated MacBook Pro. Maybe: New iPads (though I’d bet on spring instead), lower unsubsidized-cost iPhone for other (non-American) countries, updated iMac, updated Thunderbolt 2 display (with USB 3.0). Not a chance: An HDTV, a wrist-watch, a pull-string-to-talk Steve Jobs doll. How’d I do? How good were my predictions?",
