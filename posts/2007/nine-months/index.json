SimplePie has really started to take off in popularity, garnering a TON of praise from the community. We couldn’t be more thrilled.

The site keeps itself up-to-date by tapping into things I’m already doing — adding bookmarks, listening to iTunes, renting DVDs from Netflix, uploading photos to Flickr, watching funny videos on YouTube, and of course Twittering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince this is my first official “comeback” post, I’ll be integrating this blog’s posts into that site as well. Lastly, I recently had a friend pass away at the age of 29. I have the quite unfortunate knowledge that she made the conscious decision to reject a relationship with the Lord, meaning that she hasn’t actually gone to a better place like we’d all hoped. If so, I’d be throwing a party for that lucky girl because she got there before I did! Instead, I find myself mourning in the very depths of my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it got me thinking. If I was visited by an angel who told me I had 30 days to live, how would I spend \u003cem\u003etoday?\u003c/em\u003e I know the setup might sound a little odd, but let me put it into perspective: If an angel came and told me, it’s not like I could argue about it — I would know it was coming. If I’ve got 30 days, it leaves me with enough time to do a little planning so I don’t have to panic and try to cram everything into today. And if I knew I didn’t have much time left, what would I spend those precious few moments doing? Who would I spend them with? Would I stay angry at those people? Would I still be afraid to call that old friend I had a falling-out with a few years ago? Would I make long-distance friendships a greater priority? It’s really had me thinking, and I’ve been making changes to my life and my schedule appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, welcome back into the life of Ryan Parman.
