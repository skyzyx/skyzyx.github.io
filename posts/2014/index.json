        "source":"\n{{\u003c description \u003e}}\nI take password security very seriously. I’ve already written about \u003ca href=\"/tags/passwords/\"\u003ehow people can improve their password habits to keep themselves safe\u003c/a\u003e. This piece, however, is for those of you who build websites which provide password-related functionality.\n{{\u003c /description \u003e}}\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2014/crime-scene@2x.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nThis is a list of *password crimes* that some websites commit. I’ve described these crimes, then point out some criminals (a.k.a., websites) which commit these crimes.\n\n(This list is not guaranteed to continue to be up-to-date. This post represents a snapshot in time, and is accurate as of early June 2014 when the first draft of this post was written.)\n\n## Basic usability\n\n* I should always be able to change my password from within my user preferences. If I have to log out and pretend like I’ve forgotten my password in order to change it, your system is broken. ([Authy]({{% wayback \"http://authy.com\" %}}), [TunnelBear]({{% wayback \"http://tunnelbear.com\" %}}))\n\n* If *anything* with your site or service requires a password, always allow me to change it from the web — even if changing my password is the only thing I can do. ([Automatic]({{% wayback \"http://automatic.com\" %}}), [Zite]({{% wayback \"http://zite.com\" %}}), [Steam]({{% wayback \"http://steampowered.com\" %}}))\n\n* Make it super-easy to find where to change my password. Do not bury the link to make it more difficult. ([LinkedIn]({{% wayback \"http://linkedin.com\" %}}))\n\n* If my password change was successful, please tell me *very clearly*. If not, please tell me *very clearly*. ([Last.fm]({{% wayback \"http://last.fm\" %}}), [Disqus]({{% wayback \"http://disqus.com\" %}}), [Bible.com]({{% wayback \"http://bible.com\" %}}))\n\n## Provide clarity at all times\n\n* If you require my current password in order to change my password, then ask for it up-front. Don’t hide it, then surprise me. Don’t ask for it after I’ve put in my new password. Be direct and forthcoming about it. ([Kickstarter]({{% wayback \"http://kickstarter.com\" %}}), [CloudApp]({{% wayback \"http://getcloudapp.com\" %}}), [Spotify]({{% wayback \"http://spotify.com\" %}}))\n\n* Be explicitly clear about what the password requirements are. Not just the low-end — make sure you document the high-end requirements too. I often run into cases where my passwords are *too secure* for the system. ([Morgan Stanley]({{% wayback \"http://www.morganstanley.com\" %}}), [Life 360]({{% wayback \"https://life360.com\" %}}), [H\u0026R Block]({{% wayback \"http://hrblock.com\" %}}), [Zendesk]({{% wayback \"http://www.zendesk.com\" %}}), [Beatport]({{% wayback \"http://beatport.com\" %}}), [Secure Checkout by Visa]({{% wayback \"https://secure.checkout.visa.com\" %}}))\n\n* If you wait until *after* I try to change my password to tell me how long it’s allowed to be, you’re a huge jerk. ([H\u0026R Block]({{% wayback \"http://hrblock.com\" %}}), [MyFitnessPal]({{% wayback \"http://myfitnesspal.com\" %}}), [SourceForge]({{% wayback \"http://sf.net\" %}}), [Secure Checkout by Visa]({{% wayback \"https://secure.checkout.visa.com\" %}}))\n\n* If my password is too long, don’t complain that it’s *too short* and not tell me the maximum allowable length. ([Beats Music]({{% wayback \"http://beatsmusic.com\" %}}))\n\n* If you list your password requirements on your website for people to use, make sure that the ones you list are actually correct. ([Morgan Stanley]({{% wayback \"http://www.morganstanley.com\" %}}), [Secure Checkout by Visa]({{% wayback \"https://secure.checkout.visa.com\" %}}))\n\n## Avoid confusion\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2014/password-brain@2x.png\"\u003e}}\n\n* If I’ve managed to inadvertently create two accounts, make it easy for me to merge them. If you suck, and require me to delete one of them, then *actually delete the account*. ([Adobe]({{% wayback \"http://adobe.com\" %}}), [Readability]({{% wayback \"http://readability.com\" %}}), [Facebook]({{% wayback \"http://facebook.com\" %}}))\n\n* Never allow two accounts to have the same email address, then allow users to login with their email address. There is a 100% chance that this will ruin someone’s day. ([Readability]({{% wayback \"http://readability.com\" %}}), [Amazon Web Services]({{% wayback \"http://aws.amazon.com\" %}}))\n\n## Provide a useful “forgot password” page\n\n* On the “forgot password” page, always allow me to enter my email address. I may not always know some random username, but I will always know my email address. If I try to look-up my password and you ask for a username (i.e., lookup by email address is not supported), then make me go to *another* lookup for my username, your system is broken. Support both if possible, otherwise err on the side of email address. ([Pottermore]({{% wayback \"http://pottermore.com\" %}}))\n\n* If your password change/reset form(s) accepts my new password, then the login page should too. If my password doesn’t pass validation for logging in, then it shouldn’t pass when I change it via account preferences or the “forgot password” page. ([Morgan Stanley]({{% wayback \"http://www.morganstanley.com\" %}}))\n\n## Be liberal in what you accept\n\n* Never tell me that an email address with the “+” character is invalid. Yes it is. You’re dumb, you’re ugly, and your mother never loved you.\n\n* You shouldn’t be storing my real password, ever. You should only be storing a *cryptographic hash* of my password for comparison. (Never use MD5 and never use SHA–1. You should be using SHA–256 at minimum, which is 64 hexadecimal digits long.) Because of this, the following principles should always be true.\n\n    * Accept any password I give you, and be happy about it. Even if it’s 128 consecutive `NULL` bytes, or a long string of multi-byte characters, accept it gladly. Chances are, I’m smarter than your system, so allow me to be. (Anyone who limits supported characters.)\n\n    * If you accept only certain “special characters” (a.k.a., “characters” — none are “special”), be explicitly clear which ones they are. If I try to use “£” in my password, but it isn’t allowed, tell me: “Your password contains the ‘£’ character, which is not allowed.” (Usability bonus)\n\n    * If you have a length limit on passwords, the string limit should be no smaller than 64 bytes. Yes, 64 bytes. The next bank (or other service) to tell me that my password may only be 5–12 alphanumeric characters is going to immediately lose my business. ([Life 360]({{% wayback \"https://life360.com\" %}}))\n\n## Support OAuth consistently, or not at all\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2014/oauth@2x.png\"\u003e}}\n\n* If you allow me to sign-up/log-in to the desktop version of the website with [Facebook]({{% wayback \"http://facebook.com\" %}}) (or any other OAuth provider), then you must *always* have that login option available everywhere else (e.g., mobile web, native mobile app, being an OAuth provider, asking for my password to change my password).

Looking back, I spent way more time playing video games than I had in the last several years, and began following some gaming publications and podcasts. Top 5 These are my top 5 favorite games from 2013.\n5. Beyond: Two Souls (Playstation 3) Beyond: Two Souls surprised me with how good the visuals were. It had some of the best, realistic-looking humans I’ve ever seen in a game. The characters were modeled after, and voiced by, Ellen Page (Juno, Whip It, Super) and Willem Dafoe (Boondock Saints, Antichrist). It had a great story with lots of variety, so I never got bored.\nThe most interesting thing about Beyond: Two Souls was that it wasn’t really a game, so much as an interactive drama.

I’m a big fan of games with a good story, and this one had me on the edge of my seat a few times. Couple that with really solid gameplay, and this makes for an excellent game.\nLara Croft was voice-acted by Camilla Luddington, and the game offers a good arrangement of weapons and upgrades for the character. While the puzzles in the game aren’t quite like something you’d find in a Zelda game, there was still plenty of thinking and stealth involved as you moved to solve the mystery of the island.\n3. The Last of Us (Playstation 3) The Last of Us is set 20 years after a zombie outbreak. The main character, Joel, is not the same man now that he was when he lost his daughter on the first night of the outbreak. Now a smuggler, he is tasked with delivering a package to a group of freedom fighters outside of the police-state-like quarantine zone. His package is a 13-year old girl that may hold the secret to finding a cure for the infected.\nThis game pairs an excellent, excellent story, with really good gameplay and weapons. I died a lot while playing through this game on normal mode, but it was so good, and the ending had such a pay-off, that I immediately played it through a second time.\n2. Super Mario 3D World (Wii U) Nintendo is kinda like that friend you had growing up that you always had such a blast with. You don’t seem him much anymore because he’s wandered off and gotten into some really weird stuff. But every once in a while he calls you up, you go hang out, and you have a blast all over again. This is the story of Super Mario 3D World.\nThe best way that I can describe Super Mario 3D World is that it is really, really fun! All of the things you know and love about the Mario series — suits, power-ups, his friends — are all back again. But it isn’t just old-school Mario stuff; You also get to see many of the things from the Wii and DS-era Mario games (e.g., New Super Mario Bros., Super Mario 3D Land).\nEverybody knows that, with rare exception, the best games for any Nintendo console are the first-party games.

Bioshock Infinite (Xbox 360) Bioshock Infinite was my very first game in the Bioshock series (I’m currently playing through the first Bioshock now), and I must say — MIND BLOWN.

This is not Walt Disney’s version of the characters either.\nOceanhorn (iOS) There are two games that I can think of for iOS that make me feel like I’m playing a Zelda game. The first is Lili. The second, released in 2013, is Oceanhorn.\nOceanhorn is an adventure game with a very Zelda-like feel, and is one of the best games I’ve played on iOS. The touchscreen controls are straightforward and intuitive, and it even supports the Game Controller Framework in iOS 7, in case you’ve been keeping an eye out for someone to make a good one (here’s hoping CES 2014 produces something good).\nGames that I haven’t played yet These are games that I’ve heard were amazing, but I haven’t yet had a chance to play.\n The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Grand Theft Auto V Stanley Parable Rayman Legends Gone Home  ",

Couple that with really solid gameplay, and this makes for an excellent game.\n\nLara Croft was voice-acted by [Camilla Luddington]({{% wayback \"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2569832/\" %}}), and the game offers a good arrangement of weapons and upgrades for the character. While the puzzles in the game aren’t quite like something you’d find in a *Zelda* game, there was still plenty of thinking and stealth involved as you moved to solve the mystery of the island.\n\n### 3. [The Last of Us]({{% wayback \"http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com\" %}}) (Playstation 3)\n\n[*The Last of Us*]({{% wayback \"http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com\" %}}) is set 20 years after a zombie outbreak. The main character, Joel, is not the same man now that he was when he lost his daughter on the first night of the outbreak. Now a smuggler, he is tasked with delivering a package to a group of freedom fighters outside of the police-state-like quarantine zone. His package is a 13-year old girl that may hold the secret to finding a cure for *the infected*.\n\nThis game pairs an excellent, excellent story, with really good gameplay and weapons. I died *a lot* while playing through this game on normal mode, but it was so good, and the ending had such a pay-off, that I immediately played it through a second time.\n\n### 2. [Super Mario 3D World]({{% wayback \"http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\" %}}) (Wii U)\n\nNintendo is kinda like that friend you had growing up that you always had such a blast with. You don’t seem him much anymore because he’s wandered off and gotten into some really weird stuff. But every once in a while he calls you up, you go hang out, and you have a blast all over again. This is the story of [*Super Mario 3D World*]({{% wayback \"http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\" %}}).\n\nThe best way that I can describe Super Mario 3D World is that it is *really, really fun!* All of the things you know and love about the Mario series — suits, power-ups, his friends — are all back again. But it isn’t just old-school Mario stuff; You also get to see many of the things from the Wii and DS-era Mario games (e.g., *New Super Mario Bros.*, *Super Mario 3D Land*).\n\nEverybody knows that, with rare exception, the best games for any Nintendo console are the first-party games. After being (mostly) bored out of my mind with the few titles available for the Wii U (except for *New Super Mario/Luigi Bros. U* and *Zelda: Wind Waker HD*), I wasn’t sure that the game would be worth the cost. I was wrong.\n\nSuper Mario 3D World is one of the most *fun* games I’ve played in recent memory, and although I’m still working my way through it, everything about it has been an absolute delight.\n\n### 1. [Bioshock Infinite]({{% wayback \"http://www.bioshockinfinite.com\" %}}) (Xbox 360)\n\n[*Bioshock Infinite*]({{% wayback \"http://www.bioshockinfinite.com\" %}}) was my very first game in the *Bioshock* series (I’m currently playing through the first Bioshock now), and I must say — *MIND BLOWN*. From the prologue, to the twisted alternate universe, to the weapons and gameplay, to that mindf\\*\\*k of an ending, *Bioshock Infinite* is my favorite game of the year.\n\nHaving gone back and played the original Bioshock after-the-fact, I can appreciate the improvements they’ve made to the overall story and gameplay. It’s good that the main character now has someone to talk to. The controls on the original Bioshock are driving me mad, but *Infinite* has a secondary control style that is more like *Call of Duty*, which I greatly prefer.\n\n\n## Honorable mention\n\nThese are games that I thought were very good, but didn’t quite make my top 5.\n\n### [The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD]({{% wayback \"http://www.zelda.com/windwaker/\" %}}) (Wii U)\n\nI loved playing the original *Zelda: Wind Waker* on my GameCube 12 years ago. I still have it. My son plays it regularly (although he really should have beaten the game by now, come to think of it).\n\n[*Wind Waker HD*]({{% wayback \"http://www.zelda.com/windwaker/\" %}}) is an update to the game, made exclusively for the Nintendo Wii U. It has HD graphics, and some subtle improvements to the game. Sailing on the ocean is faster, so you can get from island-to-island faster. Also, the original had some interaction with the *Game Boy Advance* which has now been replaced with the *Wii U Gamepad* serving the same purpose.\n\nWhile I’ve enjoyed playing this updated version of the game, it didn’t make my top 5 for 2013 simply because the game is 12 years old. It still holds up well, though.\n\n### [The Wolf Among Us]({{% wayback \"http://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/\" %}}) (OS X; Steam)\n\n[*The Wolf Among Us*]({{% wayback \"http://www.telltalegames.com/thewolfamongus/\" %}}) is a game made in the style of a 1950’s noir detective story, but darker and grittier. All of the fairytale animals from fables have been relocated to a modern-day city called “Fabletown”. They have the ability to look human in order to avoid suspicion, and *The Big Bad “Bigby” Wolf* has become the Sheriff.\n\nYou’re investigating the murder of a young girl, and you end up crossing paths with the *Woodsman*, *Snow White*, *Ichabod Crane*, *Tweedle Dee \u0026 Dum*, and others. This is *not* Walt Disney’s version of the characters either.\n\n### [Oceanhorn]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oceanhorn/id708196645?mt=8\" %}}) (iOS)\n\nThere are two games that I can think of for iOS that make me feel like I’m playing a *Zelda* game. The first is [Lili]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lili/id560692867?mt=8\" %}}). The second, released in 2013, is [Oceanhorn]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oceanhorn/id708196645?mt=8\" %}}).\n\n*Oceanhorn* is an adventure game with a very Zelda-like feel, and is one of the best games I’ve played on iOS. The touchscreen controls are straightforward and intuitive, and it even supports the [Game Controller Framework]({{% wayback \"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ServicesDiscovery/Conceptual/GameControllerPG/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013276\" %}}) in iOS 7, in case you’ve been keeping an eye out for someone to make a good one (here’s hoping CES 2014 produces something good).\n\n\n## Games that I haven’t played yet\n\nThese are games that I’ve heard were amazing, but I haven’t yet had a chance to play.\n\n* [The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds]({{% wayback \"http://zelda.com/link-between-worlds/\" %}})\n* [Grand Theft Auto V]({{% wayback \"http://www.rockstargames.com/V/\" %}})\n* [Stanley Parable]({{% wayback \"http://www.stanleyparable.com\" %}})\n* [Rayman Legends]({{% wayback \"http://rayman.ubi.com/legends/\" %}})\n* [Gone Home]({{% wayback \"http://www.gonehomegame.com\" %}})\n"},
