And no, it’s probably not going to work with your crappy $3/mo shared hosting plan.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage-noshadow src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2017/simplepie-neue-wordmark.png\" alt=\"The SimplePie wordmark (2017–)\" figure=\"The SimplePie wordmark (2017–)\" width=\"324\"\u003e}}\n\nThe first thing you’ll probably notice is the typeface change to [SF Pro Display, Medium]({{\u003c wayback \"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\" \u003e}})—the newest (2017) version of Apple’s San Francisco typeface that it uses throughout its products and on its website. The letter spacing is still pulled-in, but much less so than before.\n\nI also added the “ɴԍ” using the following glyphs: [LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL N]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0274/index.htm\" \u003e}}), and [CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER KOMI SJE]({{\u003c wayback \"http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/50d/index.htm\" \u003e}}). I made them about 45% smaller than the rest of the text, centered them horizontally, and left the same amount of space around the word “SimplePie”.\n\nSwitching to San Francisco Pro gives the logo a cleaner, more professional look while still maintaining the overall spirit of the original logo. It’s like looking at one of those _makeover_ shows on TV.\n\n## Coming Soon…\n\nI’m planning to do a complete reboot of the website when SimplePie NG ships its 1.0 release. While you will begin seeing the _Neue_ branding here and [on GitHub]({{\u003c wayback \"https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng\" \u003e}}), look for a freshly-redesigned website with the new feel when 1.0 gets tagged and released to Composer.\n"},

Spoke with Alex and “Fat” Hector. Everyone was nice and friendly at this point. After speaking to them, we drove over there only to discover that the Jeep was being worked on so we could not test drive it. Sucks, but whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were trying to hit a specific price point for our monthly out-the-door finance payments. They wanted to charge us money for the work they did on the car (that they needed to do anyway, to my understanding). Ultimately, they couldn\u0026rsquo;t/wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hit our price, so we walked away. They continued to text message my girlfriend over the next couple of days using phrases like \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re living in a fantasy land\u0026rdquo; and other things that she and I both found incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"walking-back-into-the-_lions-den_\"\u003eWalking back into the \u003cem\u003elion’s den\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days later they got a different Jeep in stock. It was older and had 50,000 more miles, and they were asking us for the same amount that we offered for the first Jeep. I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that the car justified the cost, and I was still irritated at the way that they had spoken to my girlfriend. But she had her heart set on a Jeep, so we went back down there. We spoke to a finance guy (don\u0026rsquo;t remember his name) and signed some preliminary documents pending the outcome of the financing decision by our bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, the bank declined financing because the bank believed that the car was worth $3,000 less than what we were trying to finance the car for. Ultimately the whole deal fell apart. We felt that, for the payments that we were going to have, it made more sense to go with something new that the bank would finance, and that would come with various auto warranties. Del Sol simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be the auto dealer for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"getting-scolded\"\u003eGetting scolded\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spoke to Alex, the sales guy and explained that the bank rejected our loan, and that in light of this we felt it made more financial sense to begin speaking with a dealer that sold new cars. Alex was very upset and rude on the telephone, then hung up. That evening, we went back to Del Sol to get a refund on the cash we\u0026rsquo;d put down while waiting for the bank\u0026rsquo;s financing decision, when we were met by \u0026ldquo;Skinny\u0026rdquo; Hector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Skinny\u0026rdquo; Hector decided that before giving us the refund, it would be appropriate to verbally chastise us for \u0026ldquo;wasting their time\u0026rdquo;.
