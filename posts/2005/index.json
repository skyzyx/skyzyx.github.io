        "source":"\nToday she turns four.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/63284024_03f1dbe8e2.jpg\" alt=\"Julianna Grace Parman\"\u003e}}\n\nI have a long drive to and from work — an hour fifteen to an hour and a half, and I don’t get to spend as much quality time with my daughter as I’d like. Sure, we sit together in the car, but that’s not always the same. Whenever it’s just she and I, we’ll oftentimes make up silly songs on-the-spot, we’ll tell jokes, and I’ll ask her questions to continually try to find out what makes her tick.\n\nShe’s turning 4 today, and she just keeps growing up so fast. I’d love for her to be able to be open and know that she can talk to me about anything for as long as she’s willing to. The teenage years aren’t all that far away in the grand scheme of things, and I just want to cherish the precious few moments that we’ll have until she decides that I’m not as “cool” as I used to be. She’s smart, funny, beautiful — the perfect girl for me, if she wasn’t my daughter, of course. :) And, y’know, 4 years old.\n\nOn the weekends we’ll play, and make silly faces, and dance, and invent new words and songs, and she’s just a little ham. She’s the coolest kid I could ever ask for. There are so many things that I want to teach her, and so many things I want to do to get her a headstart in life. But some things you just can’t teach a kid until they’re ready to learn them, and I have to fight the urge to make her the kid that tests out of high school, and finishes college in 3 years, and just let her be a 4-year-old kid because that’s what she is.\n\nSometimes when she gets in trouble, I can be a little hard on her. And I hate having to punish her, but I know that if I’m a little tougher with her now, then I won’t NEED to be as tough with her as she gets older because she’ll (hopefully) be we well-behaved, respectable little firecracker. She’s very independent, and has a will as strong as mine. And I believe that God gave me a child like myself for two specific reasons (among many others, of course): (A) to teach me patience, grace, and love, and (B) because if she’d been born into any other family, Julianna would tear them up.\n\nShe’s got that strong will and that drive and it’s one of those things that gets her into a lot of trouble now, but if we teach her how to properly wield those character traits, she’ll be able to do great things with her life. Her independence will have a huge hand in the kind of leadership skills she develops (because she will most definitely be a leader). For all you LOST fans out there, I often times compare Julianna and her best friend Kylie, to Locke and Jack, respectively.\n\nOn LOST, Jack is the typical Type-A leader. People look to him for answers on what to do, and he tends to be the major decision-maker on the island. “Jack” is Kylie, Julianna’s best friend at pre-school. Julianna is more like Locke. Locke is also very much a leader. He can respect Jack’s decisions, but he’s more of a lone wolf. He goes his own way, and does his own thing. Whereas most of the survivors look to Jack as a leader, Locke sees Jack as an equal, and that really defines their dynamic.\n\nKylie will say “hey everybody, we’re going to play with the blocks today,” and all the other kids start playing with the blocks. Julianna says “I’m glad you all like playing with the blocks. Blocks are fun. But I’m going to go play with the balls. See ya.” I think that as she gets older, and Sarah and I have done our jobs, she’ll turn out like a Jack-Locke hybrid. Being the best possible father to my kids is my number 1 goal in life.\n\nMay the Lord give me the grace, strength, and wisdom I need to be able to accomplish this goal.\n"},

I listened to music on my computer, but i still listened to my CD’s more — mostly because I didn’t feel like taking the time to rip my 250 CD’s to MP3. However, having an iPod radically changed my music habits. I could carry my \u003cem\u003eentire\u003c/em\u003e music collection with me in an elegant, white, palm-sized device? Having MP3’s no longer meant that I was stuck sitting in front of my computer in order to listen to them. Well, from there it was all downhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started ripping more and more of my CD’s to MP3. I borrowed friend’s collections and started ripping CD’s as well — mostly CD’s that I’d purchased previously, but were now all scratched up. Technically I already have a license for the music that I already purchased, right? It’s not my fault CD’s aren’t all that durable. Anyways, in 2 months, I’d doubled my music collection and maxed out the capacity on my iPod. Not long after that, my wife surprised me with a \u003ca href=\"/2004/06/12/powerbook-goodness/\"\u003e17\u0026rdquo; Powerbook G4\u003c/a\u003e, and since that had more capacity, I decided to move my music collection over to my Powerbook. From there, I was free to get more and more music. I hit up all the Kazaa’s, WinMX’s, Limewire’s, and IRC’s of the world to find new music… and it was great! Mostly, I had gotten tired of the radio with all of the repetition of songs, and knowing that there was lots and lots of great music out there that wasn’t getting airplay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found some good chatrooms on IRC where I could get some compilation/sampler CD’s that had really good Alternative/Rock from bands that I’d never heard of before.

Night Shayamalan flick. A woman and her children have just moved into a house that seems to be haunted. Her children are photosensitive (allergic to light), and someone keeps opening the curtains in the rooms. The “help” (the maid, the yards keeper, and their daughter) seem to have an intimate knowledge of the house, and seem to be keeping something secret. This isn’t the typical Hollywood “gotcha” horror/suspense flick, it’s very involved and leaves a lot to the imagination, which is what makes this movie so much better than the same ol’, same ol’ crap that tends to be in this genre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: B\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory\"\u003eCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, I need to explain that you should not compare this movie to the original “Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory”. This is a different movie that has its own merits, and if you try to compare it to something it’s not, then you’ll naturally be disappointed. Tim Burton is a brilliant director who gives this film a standard Burton feel. The cinematography is all about the darker feel, the “film noir” contrast of dark and light, and the feeling of creepiness as you go through the chocolate factory tour. Gene Wilder (in the original) was a gleeful, excitable Wonka who teetered on the edge of insanity. Johnny Depp is a creepy, schizoid Wonka who doesn’t like children much, and who has issues that stem from his father being an overprotective dentist. The original was a movie for the whole family, while this remake is a movie for adults and teens who are old enough to understand the darker feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: B+\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-constant-gardener\"\u003eThe Constant Gardener\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t even heard of this movie before the day I was listening to the Ebert and Roeper podcast, and they gave the film two enthusiastic thumbs up. Usually, I have to give their thumbs a few grains of salt, although they’re usually pretty good at separating the good films from the typical Hollywood garbage. The Constant Gardener is about a British ambassador and his wife who go to Africa to help those in need. 10 minutes into the movie, she is murdered, and her husband starts digging around to find out why she was killed. At first he thinks that she was cheating on him, but as we go through the movie, he discovers that she was fighting the Pharmaceutical companies and the unethical tests they were doing on the African people, and only falls more in love with her as he realizes the strength and passion she had. This is a very well-made movie that is also very depressing.

He reminds me of the teenager who has never had it, and didn’t think he could get it, so he just gave up the fight. He’s got toy figurines from all kinds of movies and TV shows completely covering the inside of his apartment, he rides his bike everywhere he goes, and he just has that dopey ignorance about sex that teenagers have before they’ve ever done anything. One night when he reluctantly accepts an invitation to play poker with the guys, they start talking about some of their sexual escapades. When it gets to Andy (Steve Carell), he begins uncomfortably describing some details about “this one girl”, including the fact that her breasts felt wonderful like two big bags of sand. It’s at this point where his friends realize that Andy’s awkward behavior isn’t because he’s a serial killer, but rather because he’s a virgin. The point in every romantic comedy where something happens, the guy and the girl get in a fight, and it takes some sort of romantic action to bring them back together again is also here, except that it just doesn’t feel right. You kinda hit a moment of “Star Wars logic”, where the pieces don’t quite fit together, but they went with it anyways. This movie is less about American Pie-style sex gags, and more about romance and waiting for marriage before having sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBottom Line: A-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"red-eye\"\u003eRed Eye\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I heard that this movie was done by Wes Craven, I started likening the film to Scream, where the first 10 minutes is really, really good, and then it becomes a typical Hollywood “formula” movie. Not so with Red Eye. It’s definitely not a scary movie by any means, but it keeps you squirming the whole way through. A girl is on her way home on a last-minute flight, her flight is delayed, she meets a guy, they hit it off, they end up sitting next to each other on the plane, he jokes about being an assassin, and then tells her he’s serious. From then on, it’s edge of your seat the whole rest of the way through. Most movies like this, only have about 45 minutes of story, and the rest is just action filler that isn’t really all that important.

        "plain":"Every summer, I usually do a write-up of all of the movies I went to go see when I was on vacation. This year, however, I didn’t go on vacation, as this was the summer when my son was born. That, and I’m a contractor right now at my current job, so I don’t get all the benefits that include vacation time.\nSo this year, I’m going to write about the movies that I was able to see any time at all throughout the summer (they were rather sparse), and one of them was already on DVD. Let’s begin.\nThe Others The movie started out a little slow, and some of the characters were quite strange, but the ending has a twist worthy of a M. Night Shayamalan flick. A woman and her children have just moved into a house that seems to be haunted. Her children are photosensitive (allergic to light), and someone keeps opening the curtains in the rooms. The “help” (the maid, the yards keeper, and their daughter) seem to have an intimate knowledge of the house, and seem to be keeping something secret. This isn’t the typical Hollywood “gotcha” horror/suspense flick, it’s very involved and leaves a lot to the imagination, which is what makes this movie so much better than the same ol’, same ol’ crap that tends to be in this genre.\nBottom Line: B\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory First off, I need to explain that you should not compare this movie to the original “Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory”. This is a different movie that has its own merits, and if you try to compare it to something it’s not, then you’ll naturally be disappointed. Tim Burton is a brilliant director who gives this film a standard Burton feel. The cinematography is all about the darker feel, the “film noir” contrast of dark and light, and the feeling of creepiness as you go through the chocolate factory tour. Gene Wilder (in the original) was a gleeful, excitable Wonka who teetered on the edge of insanity. Johnny Depp is a creepy, schizoid Wonka who doesn’t like children much, and who has issues that stem from his father being an overprotective dentist. The original was a movie for the whole family, while this remake is a movie for adults and teens who are old enough to understand the darker feel.\nBottom Line: B+\nThe Constant Gardener I hadn’t even heard of this movie before the day I was listening to the Ebert and Roeper podcast, and they gave the film two enthusiastic thumbs up. Usually, I have to give their thumbs a few grains of salt, although they’re usually pretty good at separating the good films from the typical Hollywood garbage. The Constant Gardener is about a British ambassador and his wife who go to Africa to help those in need. 10 minutes into the movie, she is murdered, and her husband starts digging around to find out why she was killed. At first he thinks that she was cheating on him, but as we go through the movie, he discovers that she was fighting the Pharmaceutical companies and the unethical tests they were doing on the African people, and only falls more in love with her as he realizes the strength and passion she had. This is a very well-made movie that is also very depressing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, but it’s the kind of movie you only see once (much like A Beautiful Mind with Russell Crowe).\nBottom Line: A-\nThe 40 Year Old Virgin Steve Carell gives a brilliant performance as a man who reaches his 40th birthday and has never had sex.

It took me until tonight to get irritated enough to do something about it, and now I’m going to tell you how to fix it.\n\n## The Problem:\n\nI was checking out [a cool site]({{% wayback \"http://www.joshdura.com/\" %}}) tonight, and saw this:\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/qt-flash-1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of QuickTime trying to handle Flash animations\"\u003e}}\n\nHow irritating!\n\n## The Solution:\n\nOpen up your QuickTime control panel, go to the Browser tab, click Mime Types, and deselect Flash from the Miscellaneous tree option:\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/qt-flash-2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of QuickTime control panel\"\u003e}}\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/qt-flash-3.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of QuickTime control panel\"\u003e}}\n\nAfter you’ve clicked all necessary OK buttons, restart Firefox.\n\n## All Better:\n\nI went back to the [cool site]({{% wayback \"http://www.joshdura.com/\" %}}), and all was well with the world:\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/qt-flash-4.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Flash properly handling Flash animations\"\u003e}}\n\nI hope this helps someone out there Googling for “QuickTime playing Flash files” or something like that.\n"},

This had less to do with Movable Type, and more to do with a bug in the latest release of CPanel, which is what my other webhost uses (for now… I’m switching hosts for \u003ccode\u003e.com\u003c/code\u003e this month). Anyways, I couldn’t login anymore, which meant that I couldn’t export my posts from Movable Type anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo last night I had an epiphany.

Skyzyx.com will be the home of all things professional: my resume, projects like SimplePie and Tarzan that could almost be considered “Products”, and things like Web Building Resources and such. Things that are a little more static, and don’t need to be updated as often. Skyzyx.net will be more personal and experimental in nature.

I was never dead, I was just trying to balance fixing my website, caring for my new son, and figuring out how to develop JSTL-based, Ajax-enabled portlets for Oracle Portal (at work). Things are coming along. Expect lots and lots and lots of changes while I get used to this Wordpress thing, figure out how to build my own design, and generally get this forever-old redesign out and ready to go.\n"},

Everything has gone flawlessly since the move. Smart folders have made my email organization much more productive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, for all of you complaining about the new UI in Tiger Mail, quit complaining. If your beef is with the violation of Apple’s own Human Interface Guidelines, fine. But from an aesthetic point of view, Tiger Mail \u003cem\u003elooks\u003c/em\u003e a lot better than earlier versions of Mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"spotlight\"\u003eSpotlight\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use this feature constantly. For any application that isn’t in my Dock, it’s just a command-space away. But the normal Spolight search, although useful, isn’t as helpful as the new Spotlight-powered Smart Folders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"smart-folders\"\u003eSmart Folders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a neat, organized person, who likes to keep all of my applications and utilities organized away in intelligent groups and subfolders within the Applications folder. The main problem with this is using Software Update, as most Apple applications won’t update if they aren’t currently residing in their Apple-approved homes. In other words, Apple’s “application dump” style organization goes head-to-head with my neat-freak organization style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I decided to do the next best thing: Create a “Smart Applications” folder where I run all of my apps from, that I can keep organized however I want. I dumped all of my apps into the Applications folder, and all of my utilities into \u003ccode\u003e/Applications/Utilities\u003c/code\u003e. Then, I tagged the Spotlight comments of each item with a special code (\u003ccode\u003e@org-utilities-network\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003e@org-graphics\u003c/code\u003e), appropriate for the group(s) I wanted the app to be associated with. From there, I created Smart Folders for each group of applications, telling them to only search in the Applications folder, rather than the whole drive. This speeds up performance considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"automator\"\u003eAutomator\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizing all of my apps this way by hand would have been a total pain, but Automator made it a piece of cake. After taking the time to build the appropriate Automator app, I was able to just drag-and-drop whole folders of applications and have all of the items set with the appropriate Spotlight comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also have a bit of repetitive image manipulation that I do rather frequently. It used to take forever to do each image manually with Fireworks, but now, I just drop a folder of images onto my Automator app, go get a glass of milk, come back and it’s done! Brilliant!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing missing for me is the Automator equivalent of Folder Actions from Mac OS 9. I want to be able to fire an Automator action on an item whenever that item gets dropped on a folder. Anyone know how to do that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"ichat-3\"\u003eiChat 3\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill haven’t used it much, but I’m planning to give it an honest go-round. Adium and Gaim don’t seem to write my buddy lists back to the server correctly, so my iChat buddy list is all messed up. I need to fix that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"burnable-folders\"\u003eBurnable Folders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, a better way to burn data CD’s. Instead of having the Finder \u003cem\u003ecopy\u003c/em\u003e all of the files I want to burn to a temporary folder, it simply creates aliases, then resolves them during the burn. This allows the whole CD burning process to go much faster on Tiger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to this limitation in Panther, I began using a nifty little app called \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://www.thinkertons.com/burnz_features.htm\"\u003eBurnz\u003c/a\u003e. Burnz was a lifesaver during the Panther days. Since my car stereo plays MP3 CD’s, I burn a lot of them, and Tiger just made it easier for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"ical-2\"\u003eiCal 2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly have no idea what the difference is between iCal 1.5.5 and iCal 2.0, but hey, as long as it works. The only problem that I’ve had is that in Panther, I was able to sync my calendars with a PHPiCalendar installation. Now, it doesn’t work anymore. I can, however, sync with \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://www.mac.com\"\u003e.Mac\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"isync-2\"\u003eiSync 2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I got my new \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://direct.motorola.com/ENS/web_producthome.asp?Country=USA\u0026amp;language=ENS\u0026amp;productid=29544\"\u003eMotorola v330 phone\u003c/a\u003e, I just used iSync to occasionally sync my contacts and calendars to my iPod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I got my phone, I found out that with a little hacking, iSync will support my new phone. I did the hackjob, and it worked. So, I synced all of the phone numbers between my computer and my phone. Problem was, I ended up with double numbers in my phone (as I already had many of my contacts in there), and nothing new in my Address Book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I deleted all of the numbers in my phone and decided to start over fresh. Big mistake. Between the two devices, the most recent modified date was on my phone, so when I synced, I wiped out all of the phone numbers I had in my entire world. This was a sad, sad day. It toook me about 8 hours worth of phone calls and digging through my wife’s \u003ca href=\"\"\u003ePalm\u003c/a\u003e to get all of my numbers back. I finally realized that I had a month-old backup on my iPod, so I was able to pull most numbers from there. iSync saving me from iSync.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, iSync and I are friends again. Couple that with \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://www.reelintelligence.com/BluePhoneElite/\"\u003eBluePhoneElite\u003c/a\u003e, and I’m a happy camper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"mac\"\u003e.Mac\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had an iTools account back in 1999 or 2000. That expired back when Apple changed iTools to .Mac and started charging a subscription fee. Nowadays, I use this about 95% for syncing and about 5% for using the iDisk to exchange data between my personal PowerBook and my work PC.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"quicktime-7\"\u003eQuickTime 7\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coolest thing about QuickTime 7 is the super-huge trailers available from the \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/\"\u003eHD QuickTime Gallery\u003c/a\u003e. Beyond that, the improvements are completely lost on me. It’s awesome to see fantastic clarity when I play an HD trailer in full-screen without it looking like crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"address-book\"\u003eAddress Book\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with Panther, I use my Address Book constantly. It was a huge help when I wiped out all of my phone numbers (read the iSync section above). I created a set of Smart Groups that listed people in my Address Book that were (are) missing entries for phone number, address, IM name, etc., so I always know who I need to pester about getting information from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"unified-theme\"\u003eUnified Theme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a big fan of OSX’s “Aqua” theme, paticularly Panther’s Aqua. On the other hand, I can’t stand “Brushed Metal”. I think it’s a horrible theme, and should be killed. So when Apple came up with the “Unified” theme (which I’ve referred to as “toolbar-in-titlebar” in the past), I was pleasantly surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnified is basically a “smooth metal” version of Aqua. It takes the toned-down pinstripes of Panther, the multicolored close/minimize/resize buttons and throbbing blue buttons of Aqua, and combines it with a sleek metallic toolbar-in-title bar look. I think it’s fantastic, and I’m a big fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think that from here, Apple should add system-level theming — much like the feature of \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland\"\u003eCopland\u003c/a\u003e that didn’t quite make it into \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_8\"\u003eTempo\u003c/a\u003e, although all the architecture was already in place. The preference panel would allow users to choose whether they want Classic Aqua (Jaguar and older), New Aqua (Panther), Brushed Metal (iTunes and Safari), Pro (Apple’s Pro line of applications), or Unified (Tiger-style Aqua). This setting would persist across all applications in the OS, so that all apps would have a consistent look across the board (much like the UI consistency in Mac OS 9 or Windows XP).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good overview of the “many faces of Mac OS X” can be found at \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050609030045/http://www.robservatory.com/archives/2005/05/17/consistency-of-design/\"\u003eRob’s Observatory\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-performance\"\u003eSystem Performance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiger made my PowerBook feel snappier after the Simple Install I did, but it feels even faster after the Archive and Install I did two weeks ago. Beyond all Microsoftian comprehension, \u003cem\u003eTiger runs faster on the same hardware compared to Panther\u003c/em\u003e. How sweet is that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"any-problems\"\u003eAny Problems?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust two. Sometimes my phone doesn’t sync right unless I turn it off then back on again. I think that has more to do with the fact that my phone isn’t \u003cem\u003eofficially\u003c/em\u003e supported by iSync yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is that I can’t browse to my Windows SMB shares without locking up the Finder. I can connect via IP, but not by browsing to the share. I’m hoping that this will be fixed in 10.4.2 coming up this week or next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-has-tiger-enabled-me-to-do-over-panther\"\u003eWhat has Tiger enabled me to do over Panther?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOrganize my apps and utilities more intelligently\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLaunch (almost) any app, (almost) straight from the desktop\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSave myself from myself with iSync, .Mac, and Address Book\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSave time and stay organized better by automating several repetitive tasks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBurn data CD’s faster\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSync devices and data easily and automatically\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWatch full-screen trailers that actually look good full-screen\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSurf the web at blazing speeds with incredible response time\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOrganize my email more intelligently\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMore stuff that I just can’t think of right now.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I’d say that any “laggards” that haven’t yet upgraded to Tiger should do so ASAP. Once you figure out how to make features like Spotlight and Automator work for you, you’ll be amazed by what all you can accomplish.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

But the normal Spolight search, although useful, isn’t as helpful as the new Spotlight-powered Smart Folders.\nSmart Folders I’m a neat, organized person, who likes to keep all of my applications and utilities organized away in intelligent groups and subfolders within the Applications folder. The main problem with this is using Software Update, as most Apple applications won’t update if they aren’t currently residing in their Apple-approved homes. In other words, Apple’s “application dump” style organization goes head-to-head with my neat-freak organization style.\nSo, I decided to do the next best thing: Create a “Smart Applications” folder where I run all of my apps from, that I can keep organized however I want. I dumped all of my apps into the Applications folder, and all of my utilities into /Applications/Utilities. Then, I tagged the Spotlight comments of each item with a special code (@org-utilities-network, @org-graphics), appropriate for the group(s) I wanted the app to be associated with. From there, I created Smart Folders for each group of applications, telling them to only search in the Applications folder, rather than the whole drive. This speeds up performance considerably.\nAutomator Organizing all of my apps this way by hand would have been a total pain, but Automator made it a piece of cake. After taking the time to build the appropriate Automator app, I was able to just drag-and-drop whole folders of applications and have all of the items set with the appropriate Spotlight comments.\nI also have a bit of repetitive image manipulation that I do rather frequently. It used to take forever to do each image manually with Fireworks, but now, I just drop a folder of images onto my Automator app, go get a glass of milk, come back and it’s done! Brilliant!\nThe only thing missing for me is the Automator equivalent of Folder Actions from Mac OS 9. I want to be able to fire an Automator action on an item whenever that item gets dropped on a folder. Anyone know how to do that?\niChat 3 Still haven’t used it much, but I’m planning to give it an honest go-round. Adium and Gaim don’t seem to write my buddy lists back to the server correctly, so my iChat buddy list is all messed up. I need to fix that.\nBurnable Folders Finally, a better way to burn data CD’s. Instead of having the Finder copy all of the files I want to burn to a temporary folder, it simply creates aliases, then resolves them during the burn. This allows the whole CD burning process to go much faster on Tiger.\nDue to this limitation in Panther, I began using a nifty little app called Burnz. Burnz was a lifesaver during the Panther days. Since my car stereo plays MP3 CD’s, I burn a lot of them, and Tiger just made it easier for me.\niCal 2 I honestly have no idea what the difference is between iCal 1.5.5 and iCal 2.0, but hey, as long as it works. The only problem that I’ve had is that in Panther, I was able to sync my calendars with a PHPiCalendar installation. Now, it doesn’t work anymore. I can, however, sync with .Mac.\niSync 2 Before I got my new Motorola v330 phone, I just used iSync to occasionally sync my contacts and calendars to my iPod.\nAfter I got my phone, I found out that with a little hacking, iSync will support my new phone. I did the hackjob, and it worked. So, I synced all of the phone numbers between my computer and my phone. Problem was, I ended up with double numbers in my phone (as I already had many of my contacts in there), and nothing new in my Address Book.\nSo, I deleted all of the numbers in my phone and decided to start over fresh. Big mistake. Between the two devices, the most recent modified date was on my phone, so when I synced, I wiped out all of the phone numbers I had in my entire world. This was a sad, sad day. It toook me about 8 hours worth of phone calls and digging through my wife’s Palm to get all of my numbers back. I finally realized that I had a month-old backup on my iPod, so I was able to pull most numbers from there. iSync saving me from iSync.\nNow, iSync and I are friends again. Couple that with BluePhoneElite, and I’m a happy camper.\n.Mac I had an iTools account back in 1999 or 2000. That expired back when Apple changed iTools to .Mac and started charging a subscription fee. Nowadays, I use this about 95% for syncing and about 5% for using the iDisk to exchange data between my personal PowerBook and my work PC.\nQuickTime 7 The coolest thing about QuickTime 7 is the super-huge trailers available from the HD QuickTime Gallery. Beyond that, the improvements are completely lost on me. It’s awesome to see fantastic clarity when I play an HD trailer in full-screen without it looking like crap.\nAddress Book As with Panther, I use my Address Book constantly. It was a huge help when I wiped out all of my phone numbers (read the iSync section above). I created a set of Smart Groups that listed people in my Address Book that were (are) missing entries for phone number, address, IM name, etc., so I always know who I need to pester about getting information from.\nUnified Theme I’m a big fan of OSX’s “Aqua” theme, paticularly Panther’s Aqua. On the other hand, I can’t stand “Brushed Metal”. I think it’s a horrible theme, and should be killed. So when Apple came up with the “Unified” theme (which I’ve referred to as “toolbar-in-titlebar” in the past), I was pleasantly surprised.\nUnified is basically a “smooth metal” version of Aqua. It takes the toned-down pinstripes of Panther, the multicolored close/minimize/resize buttons and throbbing blue buttons of Aqua, and combines it with a sleek metallic toolbar-in-title bar look. I think it’s fantastic, and I’m a big fan.\nI think that from here, Apple should add system-level theming — much like the feature of Copland that didn’t quite make it into Tempo, although all the architecture was already in place. The preference panel would allow users to choose whether they want Classic Aqua (Jaguar and older), New Aqua (Panther), Brushed Metal (iTunes and Safari), Pro (Apple’s Pro line of applications), or Unified (Tiger-style Aqua). This setting would persist across all applications in the OS, so that all apps would have a consistent look across the board (much like the UI consistency in Mac OS 9 or Windows XP).\nA good overview of the “many faces of Mac OS X” can be found at Rob’s Observatory.\nSystem Performance Tiger made my PowerBook feel snappier after the Simple Install I did, but it feels even faster after the Archive and Install I did two weeks ago. Beyond all Microsoftian comprehension, Tiger runs faster on the same hardware compared to Panther. How sweet is that?\nAny Problems? Just two. Sometimes my phone doesn’t sync right unless I turn it off then back on again. I think that has more to do with the fact that my phone isn’t officially supported by iSync yet.\nThe second is that I can’t browse to my Windows SMB shares without locking up the Finder. I can connect via IP, but not by browsing to the share. I’m hoping that this will be fixed in 10.4.2 coming up this week or next.\nWhat has Tiger enabled me to do over Panther?  Organize my apps and utilities more intelligently Launch (almost) any app, (almost) straight from the desktop Save myself from myself with iSync, .Mac, and Address Book Save time and stay organized better by automating several repetitive tasks Burn data CD’s faster Sync devices and data easily and automatically Watch full-screen trailers that actually look good full-screen Surf the web at blazing speeds with incredible response time Organize my email more intelligently More stuff that I just can’t think of right now.  At this point, I’d say that any “laggards” that haven’t yet upgraded to Tiger should do so ASAP. Once you figure out how to make features like Spotlight and Automator work for you, you’ll be amazed by what all you can accomplish.\n",
        "source":"\nI decided to revisit this topic again as [first impressions](/archives/000420.php) aren’t always the best or most accurate impressions, and frankly, a lot can change in a month. After spending quite a bit more time exploring, I’ve learned quite a bit more about our beloved Mac OS X Tiger.\n\nSince the last time I talked about my Tiger experience, I’ve reinstalled Tiger using the “Archive and Install” option as opposed to the “Simple Install” option I used the first time. This cleared up my problem of the phantom ClamAV user account I’d mentioned before. As a bit of context, I have a 1.33 GHz 17-inch PowerBook G4 with 1GB RAM.\n\n## Safari 2\n\nSuper, super, super fast. Far and away the fastest browser I’ve ever worked with (Firefox [Deer Park Alpha 1]({{% wayback \"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/deerpark/releases/alpha1.html\" %}}) for OSX is second fastest). It’s also standards-compliant so I never have to worry about how sites are going to look switching between Safari, and my Windows browser of choice, [Firefox]({{% wayback \"http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/\" %}}). I’m also running the current nightly build of Safari, thanks to the recent open-source release by Apple of the [WebKit CVS repositories]({{% wayback \"http://webkit.opendarwin.org/\" %}}) compiled with [Xcode 2.1]({{% wayback \"http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/\" %}}).\n\nI’ve left Safari set as the default RSS reader on my system (so that clicking on the RSS icon will allow me to read selected feeds in Safari RSS), although in reality I still use [NetNewsWire]({{% wayback \"http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/\" %}}) synced with [Bloglines]({{% wayback \"http://www.bloglines.com\" %}}) (which, in turn, syncs with [FeedDemon]({{% wayback \"http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/\" %}}) on my Windows machine).\n\n## Tiger Mail (Mail 2)\n\nTiger Mail is not too shabby. I switched from [Thunderbird]({{% wayback \"http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/\" %}}) to Panther Mail back in April in anticipation of a smooth transition to Tiger Mail. Everything has gone flawlessly since the move. Smart folders have made my email organization much more productive.\n\nNow, for all of you complaining about the new UI in Tiger Mail, quit complaining. If your beef is with the violation of Apple’s own Human Interface Guidelines, fine. But from an aesthetic point of view, Tiger Mail *looks* a lot better than earlier versions of Mail.\n\n## Spotlight\n\nI use this feature constantly.

Most notable are “Round here”, “Mr. Jones”, “Perfect Blue Buildings”, “Anna Begins”, “Sullivan Street”, and “Raining in Baltimore”.\n\n* **[Much Afraid](https://song.link/album/us/i/309732023) by Jars of Clay:** The Jars of Clay 1995 debut was a fantastic acoustic alternative album. I saw them perform on the Dove Awards show, and went out and bought their CD the next day. However, their 1997 followup was even better than the first. The depth of emotion on this album rivals that of AAEA, but this album reaches further into the *soul*. I still find myself singing along to the fantastic harmonies on this album. Most notable are “Overjoyed”, “Fade to grey”, “Frail”, “Weighed down”, and “Hymn”.\n\n* **[Pray For Rain](https://song.link/album/us/i/716051089) by PFR:** Beatles-inspired Alternative Rock at it’s best. This 1992 debut album put the group on the map as one of Christian music’s favorite artists. Far and away the most talented band ever in terms of complete composition of an album. From lyrics to musicianship to harmonies… this album nails everything right on the head. When they broke up in 1996, it had nearly the same emotional impact as when Princess Diana was killed. They came together to release a new album in 2001 called Disappear, but I haven’t heard anything new from them since. Most notable are “You Lord”, “Do you want to know love”, “Didn’t he love them”, “Pray for rain”, and “Stay”.\n\n## Part II: Five songs I listen to a lot\n\n* **[Let Me Go](https://song.link/us/i/42281649) by 3 Doors Down:** New song that just rocks out!\n\n* **[Same In The End](https://song.link/us/i/1125497066) by Sublime:** A classic that rocks as hard now as it always has.\n\n* **[Science of Selling Yourself Short](https://song.link/us/i/1420790) by Less Than Jake:** All that’s left of third-wave Ska.\n\n* **_Don’t Stop_ by San Francisco Trance DJs Mars and Mystrë:** Takes me back to my short-lived raver days. An infectious cyber-trance anthem by the best DJ’s ever.\n\n* **[Every New Day](https://song.link/us/i/867557401) by Five Iron Frenzy:** Awe inspiring. Makes me so thankful that the emotion just overwhelms, and I start bawling like a little girl while I sing this at the top of my lungs.\n\n## Five people to whom I am passing the musical baton\n\n* **[Paul Griffin:]({{% wayback \"http://www.relativelyabsolute.com/\" %}})** Web designer/developer/programmer turned prep cook, Paul and I have collaborrated a bit on a project or two, and I’d be interested in seeing what his musical tastes and interests are.\n\n* **[Jeremy Flint:]({{% wayback \"http://www.jeremyflint.com/\" %}})** It seems that Jeremy was passed the baton overnight, so his list is posted [here]({{% wayback \"http://www.jeremyflint.com/archives/2005/05/17/a-musical-baton-2/\" %}}).\n\n* **[Cameron Moll:]({{% wayback \"http://www.cameronmoll.com/\" %}})** I came across Cameron’s site a while back after he’d linked to me because he was using one of my JavaScripts on his site. After looking at this gorgeous site, I submitted it to the [CSS Vault]({{% wayback \"http://www.cssvault.com\" %}}). I’d be interested to see what kind of music he’s into…\n\n* **[Sharif Ewees:]({{% wayback \"http://www.blueplaidshirt.com/\" %}})** I forget how I came across Sharif… probably around the time of the [Multiple IE Revelation](/archives/000094.php). Anyways, I’ve been reading his site ever since, and I’d love to see what he’s into.\n\n* **[Stijn “Sken” De Meyere:]({{% wayback \"http://www.sken.be/blog/\" %}})** Formerly an English blog, and now written in, um, something else that I can’t read, Sken’s got to have something interesting on his iPod.\n"},

Instructions taken from this page are as follows:\n You can tell that HME is activated if on the Main TiVo Screen the “Music \u0026amp; Photos” menu option is now called “Music, Photos \u0026amp; More”.\nYou will need to re-enable HME every time your TiVo Reboots.\nIf HME isn’t already enabled on your Tivo running Software verson 7.x or above go all the way into the System Infomation screen and enter CLEAR-CLEAR-0-0 on your remote (there will be no direct feedback that it did anything).\nReturn to the Main TiVo Screen and you should see “Music, Photos \u0026amp; More” listed.\n Prepping your computer Go ahead and connect the Airport Express to your home network, if you haven’t already. The instructions for that are outside the scope of this posting. Connect your speakers (home stereo or surround sound system, preferably) to your Airport Express.\nLaunch the iSee iTunes application and allow it to start up. On Mac OS X, I had to open a port to make it all work properly. Open up the “Sharing” System Preference, and go to the “Firewall” tab. Create a new entry called “iSee iTunes” (or whatever you want to name it), and set the port value to 7288. Hopefully it’s the same on your system. If not, you can run Rendezvous Browser (OSX-only) to find what port iSee iTunes is wanting to run on.\nBringing It All Home Launch iTunes, and start playing the music through your Airport Express to your home stereo (or whatever you’re using to play the audio through). I assume that it will be in the same room as your TiVo’d TV (since that would make the most sense).\nTurn on your TV, and bring up the TiVo main menu. Choose “Music, Photos \u0026amp; More”, and then \u0026ldquo;iSee iTunes on \u0026lt;server name\u0026gt;“. When the iSee iTunes menu comes up, choose the ”Now Playing\u0026rdquo; option, and iSee iTunes will display the track name, artist, rating, and album art on your TV. The forward and back buttons work the Next/Previous track in iTunes. You can even pause as necessary.\nThere! You now have your music playing on your home stereo and a visual layout of the track info and album art all together. (Almost-)instant Home Media Center!\nAlternate Method An alternative method that I’ve tried out worked well since I have a PC and TiVo’d TV in my bedroom, and I have some 5.1 Surround speakers connected to my Windows XP machine. I launched iTunes, iSee iTunes, and Nicecast on my Powerbook. I broadcast a signal (via Nicecast) to iTunes on my PC, and had the audio play through my fancy speakers. Meanwhile, I used iSee iTunes to display the cool music info on my TV screen. Not quite as fancy, but still works well.\n",
        "source":"\nI think I’ve discovered a great concoction for building your own makeshift Media Center System. TiVo is already pretty great at managing your TV shows, but the method I’m about to discuss add a viable music option to the mix. Luckily, I had nearly everything already, and just didn’t know it until this morning.\n\n## What do we need?\n\nBefore we get started, we need to make sure that we have everything we need:\n\n1. Either a Windows 2000/XP PC or a Mac running OSX\n2. A TV (which I think just about everyone has)\n3. A [Networked]({{% wayback \"http://www.tivo.com/4.9.16.asp\" %}}) [TiVo Series2]({{% wayback \"http://www.tivo.com/2.1.asp\" %}}) with [system software 7.1]({{% wayback \"http://www.tivo.com/4.9.19.1.asp\" %}}) or better\n4. [iTunes]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/\" %}})\n5. [TiVo2Go Software]({{% wayback \"http://www.tivo.com/4.9.19.1.asp\" %}}) (Mac or PC)\n6. [iSee iTunes]({{% wayback \"http://homepage.mac.com/kylecopeland/FileSharing11.html\" %}}) software (Mac or PC)\n7. [Airport Express]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/\" %}})\n8. Speakers of some sort that are connected to your Airport Expres\n\nThis next part is the initial setup that you’ll need for the method that I’m about to explain.\n\n## Prepping your TiVo\n\nIf you haven’t already, you’ll want to begin by connecting your TiVo to your home network. You can get started by going over the [TiVo Network Setup Instructions]({{% wayback \"http://customersupport.tivo.com/userWelcome.asp?path=2\u0026faq_node=Network\" %}}). This will involve purchasing either a wired or wireless (11 Mbps; 802.11b) network adapter for your TiVo. If you’re going wireless, remember to allow `802.11b` devices on your network, and understand that TiVo only understands WEP security — not the newer WPA. I was ready to rip my hair out over this before I figured out what the problem was.\n\nNext you’ll need to get system software version 7.1 (or newer) installed. Assuming you know how to work a TiVo, go into the System Settings screen and check what software version you have. If it’s older than v7.1, you’ll have to [request the update]({{% wayback \"http://www.tivo.com/priority\" %}}). It can take up to 3 days for your TiVo to receive the software update.\n\nAfter you’ve got version 7.1 or newer installed, you have to enable a hidden mode called the HME mode (which I think stands for Home Media Entertainment, although I could be completely wrong). Instructions taken from [this page]({{% wayback \"http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?p=2671410\" %}}) are as follows:\n\n\u003e You can tell that HME is activated if on the Main TiVo Screen the “Music \u0026 Photos” menu option is now called “Music, Photos \u0026 More”.\n\u003e\n\u003e You will need to re-enable HME every time your TiVo Reboots.\n\u003e\n\u003e If HME isn’t already enabled on your Tivo running Software verson 7.x or above go all the way into the System Infomation screen and enter `CLEAR-CLEAR-0-0` on your remote (there will be no direct feedback that it did anything).\n\u003e\n\u003e Return to the Main TiVo Screen and you should see “Music, Photos \u0026 More” listed.\n\n## Prepping your computer\n\nGo ahead and connect the Airport Express to your home network, if you haven’t already.

I assume that it will be in the same room as your TiVo’d TV (since that would make the most sense).\n\nTurn on your TV, and bring up the TiVo main menu. Choose “Music, Photos \u0026 More”, and then \"iSee iTunes on *\u0026lt;server name\u0026gt;*“. When the iSee iTunes menu comes up, choose the ”Now Playing\" option, and iSee iTunes will display the track name, artist, rating, and album art on your TV. The forward and back buttons work the Next/Previous track in iTunes. You can even pause as necessary.\n\nThere! You now have your music playing on your home stereo and a visual layout of the track info and album art all together.

Not bad. I’ve spent a little bit of time playing with it, and it seems like query results are cached because subsequent searches for the same query are much faster the second time around. I’ve heard people complaining about the moving “Top Hit” while the results come back, but that just plain makes sense. AJAX anyone? Hello? Asynchronous?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dashboard\"\u003eDashboard:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill looking for the be-all-end-all widget, but it’s been very useful already. Weather is usually pretty bi-polar this time of year, so the weather widget has been cool. After \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050424065456133\"\u003ehacking the phonebook widget\u003c/a\u003e, it’s also proven useful already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther cool widgets are: Air Traffic Control, Album Art (a complement to the iTunes widget), Bloglines Notifier, Capture, iTunes Connection Monitor (if you share your music on a network), JiWire (for finding wireless hotspots; US-only?), NowPlaying (for your networked TiVo), Transmit widget (drag-and-drop FTP), Whoisdget (a whois querier), and Yahoo! Traffic. Most of these you can get from Apple’s Dashboard page, but others you can probably Google for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother point is made about the potential for \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://www.tuaw.com/2005/05/07/the-problem-with-widgets/\"\u003edestructive widgets\u003c/a\u003e and a new form of adware/spyware on the Mac platform. It’s worth a read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still have \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://www.konfabulator.com/\"\u003eKonfabulator\u003c/a\u003e installed, however. Konfabulator has the ability to display widgets on-screen at all times (which is useful with the iCal Events widget). It also has a much larger library of widgets than Dashboard. Konfabulator will definitely be around on my system for a long time to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"ichat-3\"\u003eiChat 3\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill can’t get on the other popular protocols, so it’s of little use to me.

It also still doesn’t support tabbed windows. *sigh*. I’d like to say that the upside is that audio/video conferencing is pretty awesome, but I haven’t the chance to try it with anybody yet. Ah well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"safari-2\"\u003eSafari 2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuper-freaking-fast. The RSS features are cool too, but since the new beta of NetNewsWire now supports Bloglines (like Feed Demon does), that’s my current RSS reader of choice. It does, however, also tie into Tiger’s new RSS Screensaver. Check it out! Also, you can swap Safari’s Brished Metal appearance for the new Tiger titlebar-in-toolbar theme using \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://madbeaner.fuckyouanddie.com/random/SafariUnify.dmg\"\u003eSafari Unify\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"mail-2\"\u003eMail 2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEh. That’s about all I can say. The new interface is slick, but doesn’t match anything else in the system, which is generally bad UI practice. Apple needs to pick one UI (Aqua, Brushed Metal, Mail 2, or Tiger’s new titlebar-in-toolbar theme) and just stick with it… period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe addition of Smart Folders is a huge plus for me. I get tons of email everyday, so setting up various smart folders has been a big help. Good job with the system-level searching system, Apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"quicktime-7\"\u003eQuickTime 7\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/\"\u003eHD trailers\u003c/a\u003e made possible by the new H.264 format, but other than that it seems to be the same as every other QuickTime release since 3.0. ## Address Book and iCal 2. There aren’t enough good things I can say about iCal, and Address Book has always been a helpful utility. Now you can add birthdays from the Address Book to iCal automatically, which is helpful. I used to sync my calendars to a PHPiCalendar installation, but that doesn’t seem to be working for me anymore for some reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddress Book now supports Smart Groups which I’m currently using to let me know who has a birthday coming up in the next month. I’m sure I’ll do more with it in time, I just haven’t yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"overall-system-performance\"\u003eOverall System Performance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiger feels a bit snappier than Panther did… at least when running Apple applications. Most of the other apps feel about the same, but I’m sure newer versions will be faster as they’re built using Tiger API’s and such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"other-stuff\"\u003eOther Stuff\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApple lists \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://www.apple.com/macosx/newfeatures/over200.html\"\u003eover 200 new features\u003c/a\u003e on the Tiger site — some of which I’ve played with and others I’ve not.

The name is \u003ccode\u003eclamav\u003c/code\u003e, which is the name of some open-source antivirus software being bundled with Tiger Server (no, I don’t have Tiger Server… just Tiger). However, I did have the ClamAV software installed prior to upgrading to Tiger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVisiting the \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://www.clamav.net/faq.html\"\u003eClamAV FAQ\u003c/a\u003e, I see the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I remove the clamav account from my MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clamav user was set up by Apple and we don’t know anything about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the password for the clamav user on MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clamav user was set up by Apple who has not told us the password they use, please contact Apple support for help.

Overall my experience has been pretty positive. If you haven’t upgraded yet, and features like Spotlight and Dashboard aren’t compelling enough to upgrade at the moment, I’d say to wait until 10.4.1 or 10.4.2 comes out. Don’t get me wrong… you should definitely upgrade, but hopefully some of the minor quirks will be worked out in an upcoming point-release.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
        "plain":"I just installed Tiger 2 nights ago. I did a basic Simple Install, with no backup or disk checking or anything… just crossed fingers. Bad idea, I know. I guess my excitement just got the best of me.\nLuckily I didn’t have any kind of earth-shattering problems. The only problems I’ve had so far are minor annoyances — nothing I wouldn’t expect from a point-oh release… but I’ll get to those later. Let’s go over some of the features.\nDiscussion of Features Here’s my experience with the most notable new “features” of Tiger.\nSpotlight: Post-install, it only took about 20 minutes to index about 60GB of data on my 1.33 GHz 17\u0026rdquo; Powerbook G4 with 1GB RAM. Not bad. I’ve spent a little bit of time playing with it, and it seems like query results are cached because subsequent searches for the same query are much faster the second time around. I’ve heard people complaining about the moving “Top Hit” while the results come back, but that just plain makes sense. AJAX anyone? Hello? Asynchronous?\nDashboard: Still looking for the be-all-end-all widget, but it’s been very useful already. Weather is usually pretty bi-polar this time of year, so the weather widget has been cool. After hacking the phonebook widget, it’s also proven useful already.\nOther cool widgets are: Air Traffic Control, Album Art (a complement to the iTunes widget), Bloglines Notifier, Capture, iTunes Connection Monitor (if you share your music on a network), JiWire (for finding wireless hotspots; US-only?), NowPlaying (for your networked TiVo), Transmit widget (drag-and-drop FTP), Whoisdget (a whois querier), and Yahoo! Traffic. Most of these you can get from Apple’s Dashboard page, but others you can probably Google for.\nAnother point is made about the potential for destructive widgets and a new form of adware/spyware on the Mac platform. It’s worth a read.\nI still have Konfabulator installed, however. Konfabulator has the ability to display widgets on-screen at all times (which is useful with the iCal Events widget). It also has a much larger library of widgets than Dashboard. Konfabulator will definitely be around on my system for a long time to come.\niChat 3 Still can’t get on the other popular protocols, so it’s of little use to me. I use Adium primarily on my Mac (Gaim on Windows). iChat opens multiple buddy lists for Jabber and AIM protocols, which is pretty annoying. It also still doesn’t support tabbed windows. *sigh*. I’d like to say that the upside is that audio/video conferencing is pretty awesome, but I haven’t the chance to try it with anybody yet. Ah well.\nSafari 2 Super-freaking-fast. The RSS features are cool too, but since the new beta of NetNewsWire now supports Bloglines (like Feed Demon does), that’s my current RSS reader of choice. It does, however, also tie into Tiger’s new RSS Screensaver. Check it out! Also, you can swap Safari’s Brished Metal appearance for the new Tiger titlebar-in-toolbar theme using Safari Unify.\nMail 2 Eh. That’s about all I can say. The new interface is slick, but doesn’t match anything else in the system, which is generally bad UI practice. Apple needs to pick one UI (Aqua, Brushed Metal, Mail 2, or Tiger’s new titlebar-in-toolbar theme) and just stick with it… period.\nThe addition of Smart Folders is a huge plus for me. I get tons of email everyday, so setting up various smart folders has been a big help. Good job with the system-level searching system, Apple.\nQuickTime 7 I like the HD trailers made possible by the new H.264 format, but other than that it seems to be the same as every other QuickTime release since 3.0. ## Address Book and iCal 2. There aren’t enough good things I can say about iCal, and Address Book has always been a helpful utility. Now you can add birthdays from the Address Book to iCal automatically, which is helpful. I used to sync my calendars to a PHPiCalendar installation, but that doesn’t seem to be working for me anymore for some reason.\nAddress Book now supports Smart Groups which I’m currently using to let me know who has a birthday coming up in the next month. I’m sure I’ll do more with it in time, I just haven’t yet.\nOverall System Performance The Tiger feels a bit snappier than Panther did… at least when running Apple applications. Most of the other apps feel about the same, but I’m sure newer versions will be faster as they’re built using Tiger API’s and such.\nOther Stuff Apple lists over 200 new features on the Tiger site — some of which I’ve played with and others I’ve not. Many of them aren’t particularly news-worthy though.\nProblems So Far There are a few quirks that I’ve run into thus far. Hopefully they’ll be fixed in 10.4.1 due out soon.\nNew ClamAV User For some reason, I now have a second user listed on my login screen (I’m only supposed to have one). The name is clamav, which is the name of some open-source antivirus software being bundled with Tiger Server (no, I don’t have Tiger Server… just Tiger). However, I did have the ClamAV software installed prior to upgrading to Tiger.\nVisiting the ClamAV FAQ, I see the following:\n How do I remove the clamav account from my MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?\nThe clamav user was set up by Apple and we don’t know anything about it.\nWhat is the password for the clamav user on MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?\nThe clamav user was set up by Apple who has not told us the password they use, please contact Apple support for help. You may find that sudo password clamav in a terminal session helps to change the password, however we cannot support the option.\n Windows SMB Sharing: I can still connect to my Windows shares by typing in the IP address, but using the browse utility causes Finder to hang and crash. That’s no good.\nMy Menubar Clock is in the Wrong Place: Minor annoyance, but annoying nonetheless.\n  Wrap Up So that’s it! Overall my experience has been pretty positive. If you haven’t upgraded yet, and features like Spotlight and Dashboard aren’t compelling enough to upgrade at the moment, I’d say to wait until 10.4.1 or 10.4.2 comes out.

The show was full of deep relationships, whether comfortable and casual (Syd, Will, and Francie), intense and angst-ridden (Syd and Jack/Irina), or filled with romantic tension (when Vaughn was still with Alice). All of those relationships are missing this season, with no replacements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContinuing storylines/multiple missions per episode.\u003c/strong\u003e Alias was very edgy and fast-paced. There was always so much that happened that it almost left your head spinning by the end (in a good way, of course). Many episodes were cliffhangers going into the next, and they had a feeling of continuity to them. This season feels very… disconnected.

Seasons 1 and 2 had that. There were so many questions, and you didn’t know who to trust, or what would happen next. There’s nothing like that in season 4 so far.\n  Depth of character relationships. From Sydney finding Danny dead in their bathtub in the pilot, to the awkwardness of the kiss with Will, to the heart-tugging involved with Sydney’s mom. The show was full of deep relationships, whether comfortable and casual (Syd, Will, and Francie), intense and angst-ridden (Syd and Jack/Irina), or filled with romantic tension (when Vaughn was still with Alice). All of those relationships are missing this season, with no replacements.\n  Continuing storylines/multiple missions per episode. Alias was very edgy and fast-paced.

No, she’s definitely not a geek like me, but I seem to have passed along the “Electronics and Gadgets Virus” to her. I am absolutely stunned by the coolness that is TiVo.\n\nPausing live TV? Record anything you want by saying “Record this show whenever it happens to be on.” It actually came in handy tonight when we were watching [24]() tonight. A couple of friends of ours were going to come over to watch it with us, but were running about 10 minutes behind. Never fear, TiVo is here! We simply *paused TV* and waited for them to get there. Brilliant.\n\nTiVo is better than a VCR for a number of reasons. First, tapes suck. And they get old and dusty. And they suck. But with the coolness that is TiVo, there is no tape—it’s all digital. TiVo can also record shows for you that it thinks you might be interested in. Right now it doesn’t seem to be guessing that well, but we’ve only had it for a couple of days. I’m sure it’ll get better.\n\nWe can record the entire seasons of [24](https://trakt.tv/shows/24), [Alias](https://trakt.tv/shows/alias), and [American Idol](https://trakt.tv/shows/american-idol) with only a few button clicks. Granted it can’t hold three entire seasons of TV shows at once, but it can hold a few weeks at a time so that I don’t have to worry about getting home late from work or going on vacation.\n\nRight now I’ve got it plugged into my phone line while I wait for my wireless adapter to get here. Actually, I’m waiting for a second TiVo (for our bedroom), a wired ethernet adapter (for the one in our bedroom), AND the wireless adapter to get here so that I can connect them to my home network. I’ve read that I can pull recorded shows from my TiVo onto my computer. Since I haven’t heard anything other than that about the networking abilities, I’ve got some questions:\n\n1. What format/codec are the shows recorded in?\n\n2. Since I’ve already got Nero 6.6 Ultra, do I really need to buy that other program listed on the TiVo website to burn them to DVD?\n\n3. Is it true that there are traces of DRM in the recorded TV shows? Any way to strip it?\n\n4. How easy is it to compress the video into a computer-friendly format like QuickTime, MPEG, DivX, or Windows Media?\n\n5. How long does it typically take for a 1-hour show recorded on “Best” to transfer from one TiVo to another?\n\n6. All I’ve seen are 802.11b wireless adapters. Any 802.11g adapters known to work?\n\n7. Any other nifty-cool things I can do with TiVo with or without a network?\n\nTo be honest, I’m not really a TV person at all, with the exception of the 3 previously mentioned shows… I typically watch movies. But being able to sort through all the TV in the world and watch only the interesting things when I’m home is a fantastic opportunity. It’ll also allow me to watch shows that I like, but haven’t gotten into watching yet. I used to watch [Veronica Mars](https://trakt.tv/shows/veronica-mars) before the holidays, but never got back into it. I also hear that J.J. Abrams *other* show [LOST](https://trakt.tv/shows/lost) is really good too (J.J. is also the creator of Alias).\n\nAlthough historically I’ve never really liked TV, I’m beginning to see some awesome possibilities here. Has anyone got any other TiVo-related thoughts or ideas to share?\n"},
