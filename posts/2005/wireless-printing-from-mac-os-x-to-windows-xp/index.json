The router’s address is \u003ccode\u003e192.168.0.2\u003c/code\u003e, and that keeps things simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the router, slot 1 plugs into my desktop PC running Windows XP, and assigns an IP (range of \u003ccode\u003e192.168.0.4\u003c/code\u003e - \u003ccode\u003e192.168.0.10\u003c/code\u003e) via DHCP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlot 2 is a loose wire that plugs into my laptop when I’m sitting at my desk.

The Airport Express is manually assigned \u003ccode\u003e192.168.0.3\u003c/code\u003e, and spits out IP addresses in the \u003ccode\u003e192.168.1.x\u003c/code\u003e range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost things worked great.

So I decided to do some fiddling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo tell the truth, I’d’ve probably just left it alone had I not had an idea of what to do (you like my double-contraction there, don’t you? “I’d’ve.” You know you do…). I got tipped off by reading somewhere about iTunes playlist sharing, which I do at work regularly. \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;gloat\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e\u003cem\u003eWell, really, most people share from me as I have the largest MP3 collection at work so far with over 5000 legit songs.\u003c/em\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;/gloat\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e But what I read was that it used to work via any IP, but because some people were irresponsible with it (stealing music), Apple restricted this functionality to those network users \u003cem\u003eon the same subnet\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmm… now I know that it isn’t exactly the same as having \u003cem\u003esubnet\u003c/em\u003e, but what if I changed the settings on my Airport Express to assign IP’s in the same range (\u003ccode\u003e192.168.0.x\u003c/code\u003e) as my wired router? I figured I’d give it a try, and sure enough, it worked.

I added the shared printer with no problems, and am finally able to print wirelessly from my Mac to my PC’s desk printer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo kids, that’s the trick. If you’re at home with 254 or less IP-needing devices (I believe that 192.168.0.255 is reserved for something or another), you can tell your routers to assign certain ranges of IP’s all in the same happy little group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this can help at least one person out there someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
