This is a relatively minor update where only three things were changed: I resolved some localization issues that primarily affected France, Germany, and Japan. If you’re currently localized as an english-speaking country, you probably won’t notice anything new. However, setting the character encoding for your Tarzan-enabled pages to UTF–8 is highly recommended for US, UK, and Canadian installations, and required for French, German, and Japanese installations.
