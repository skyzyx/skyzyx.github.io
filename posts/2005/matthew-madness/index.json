His due date has just completely snuck up on me. “Ah, we have time…”, but apparently not. I’m trying to remember life with a newborn. All I remember about last time is that it was miserable getting up in the middle of the night, and hating life when it was my turn to get up with the baby. My daughter Julianna is super excited to meet her brother, “Baby Matthew”, that we’ve been talking about for the last eight months (well, actually only four months, because that was when we found out it was a boy; before it was just “The Baby”).",
