The show was full of deep relationships, whether comfortable and casual (Syd, Will, and Francie), intense and angst-ridden (Syd and Jack/Irina), or filled with romantic tension (when Vaughn was still with Alice). All of those relationships are missing this season, with no replacements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContinuing storylines/multiple missions per episode.\u003c/strong\u003e Alias was very edgy and fast-paced. There was always so much that happened that it almost left your head spinning by the end (in a good way, of course). Many episodes were cliffhangers going into the next, and they had a feeling of continuity to them. This season feels very… disconnected. I believe that self-contained episodes plays a large role in this. Also with the whole one-mission-at-a-time thing, this season feels very slow by comparison. Comparing Alias seasons 1 or 2 to the Fox show “24”, they were right on par as the two best shows on TV. Now, only 24 can hold that spot because Alias felt the need to reinvent itself again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent relationships are very wrong.\u003c/strong\u003e Jack hated Irina, then trusted her for a season (3), and then killed her. WTF? Dixon and Sloane work together now, but didn’t they kill each other’s wives? Didn’t Slone get the death penalty by lethal injection last season? And now he’s everybody’s boss? I know that they’re trying to fix the show this season, but they’re asking us to forget an awful lot about the characters we know and love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToo much Sydney.\u003c/strong\u003e Sydney is in nearly every single scene of every single episode. What about scenes like when Will was investigating Danny’s death? Or when Sloane and Sark or Irina were working together? Or scenes between Arvin and Emily Sloane? The show needs more character balance. I like Sydney too, but it’s getting to be too much of a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eToo much sex, not enough character.\u003c/strong\u003e I know that making the show “sexier” may be a way to get more viewers, but I think it’s a detriment to the show. Syd is sexy, but also very intelligent and capable. We don’t need to see her in bikinis or lingere to know she’s hot, because that’s not her sole characteristic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSydney needs to have some fun.\u003c/strong\u003e That’s one of the biggest problems of last season that JJ said would get fixed, but it hasn’t happened yet. And even then, how can it? She’s only just met her sister. How can they have fun like best friends do? Syd, Francie, and Will had an awesome dynamic that I don’t think can be filled by adding some new character. She needs to feel a closeness with people to be able to relax and have fun, but she doesn’t have that. Since Will is the only one still alive, he really needs to make a full-time comeback. But in order for him to fit in this season, they really need to go back to a season 1 or 2 format for shows — when there was room for other characters with or without Sydney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverything is inside.\u003c/strong\u003e Have you noticed that? She’s never \u003cem\u003eout\u003c/em\u003e doing stuff anymore. She’s always in a room somewhere doing whatever it is she does. It may be minor (like complaining about lighting), but it can really set the right mood for the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe like “24”.\u003c/strong\u003e It used to be. The shows were very comparable: season-long plots, deep characters, mysterious and intense, very edgy. Now Alias has turned into a show just like every other so-so show on TV, while “24” is still awesome! You’d better bet that I’m at the edge of my seat waiting to find out what’s going to happen next to Jack Bauer from CTU. I used to feel that way about Alias… even in season 3 (although season 3 just got really heavy and dark). I want to feel that way again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBack to roots.\u003c/strong\u003e Rather than continuing to try to reinvent itself, Alias needs to go back to being the show it was during the first two seasons simply because it was a winning formula for a fantastic show. Maybe it didn’t get as many viewers, but it was a much better show. And again, if “24” can do it, why can’t Alias?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love this show so much that it makes my physically sick to my stomach to see this show in the rut it’s in.
