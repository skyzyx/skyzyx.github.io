After several months of development, my hard drive fried, and I lost nearly everything. This was rather discouraging, and as such I didn’t get around to beginning development fresh until April-ish of this year. I got Wordpress installed (I love the 5 minute install), exported the then-current entries, and imported everything into Wordpress… no problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge part of this redesign is an overhaul of the information architecture. This site has grown far beyond what I had initially anticipated, and I was still using 2 year old IA. So, I began organizing my categories as much as possible, and placing posts in multiple categories, where appropriate. About 2 months ago, I started getting 500 errors in Movable Type. This had less to do with Movable Type, and more to do with a bug in the latest release of CPanel, which is what my other webhost uses (for now… I’m switching hosts for \u003ccode\u003e.com\u003c/code\u003e this month). Anyways, I couldn’t login anymore, which meant that I couldn’t export my posts from Movable Type anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo last night I had an epiphany. Log onto my \u003ccode\u003e.com\u003c/code\u003e server, backup my Movable Type database, install Movable Type on my \u003ccode\u003e.net\u003c/code\u003e server, import the database backup, and use the MT interface to do a formal export, which I then imported back into Wordpress. The whole thing took about 15 minutes to accomplish, after spending the last two months frustrated over the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I’m moving Skyzyx.com to the same host that I have Skyzyx.net at: Dreamhost. Dreamhost is freakin’ awesome, and that’s all I have to say about that. Anyways, all of the content that is currently at Skyzyx.com will still exist once my dual-site strategy goes live. Skyzyx.com will be the home of all things professional: my resume, projects like SimplePie and Tarzan that could almost be considered “Products”, and things like Web Building Resources and such. Things that are a little more static, and don’t need to be updated as often. Skyzyx.net will be more personal and experimental in nature. This is where my weblog will live, along with experimental software, CVS repositories, etc. This is the plan today, anyways. Or I might simply have any address at Skyzyx.com redirect to the same files Skyzyx.net, or vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I’m back. I was never dead, I was just trying to balance fixing my website, caring for my new son, and figuring out how to develop JSTL-based, Ajax-enabled portlets for Oracle Portal (at work). Things are coming along. Expect lots and lots and lots of changes while I get used to this Wordpress thing, figure out how to build my own design, and generally get this forever-old redesign out and ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n",
