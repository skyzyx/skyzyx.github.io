The RSS features are cool too, but since the new beta of NetNewsWire now supports Bloglines (like Feed Demon does), that’s my current RSS reader of choice. It does, however, also tie into Tiger’s new RSS Screensaver. Check it out! Also, you can swap Safari’s Brished Metal appearance for the new Tiger titlebar-in-toolbar theme using \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507201431/http://madbeaner.fuckyouanddie.com/random/SafariUnify.dmg\"\u003eSafari Unify\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"mail-2\"\u003eMail 2\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEh.

There aren’t enough good things I can say about iCal, and Address Book has always been a helpful utility. Now you can add birthdays from the Address Book to iCal automatically, which is helpful.

The RSS features are cool too, but since the new beta of NetNewsWire now supports Bloglines (like Feed Demon does), that’s my current RSS reader of choice. It does, however, also tie into Tiger’s new RSS Screensaver. Check it out! Also, you can swap Safari’s Brished Metal appearance for the new Tiger titlebar-in-toolbar theme using [Safari Unify]({{% wayback \"http://madbeaner.fuckyouanddie.com/random/SafariUnify.dmg\" %}}).\n\n## Mail 2\n\nEh. That’s about all I can say. The new interface is slick, but doesn’t match anything else in the system, which is generally bad UI practice. Apple needs to pick one UI (Aqua, Brushed Metal, Mail 2, or Tiger’s new titlebar-in-toolbar theme) and just stick with it… period.\n\nThe addition of Smart Folders is a huge plus for me. I get tons of email everyday, so setting up various smart folders has been a big help. Good job with the system-level searching system, Apple.\n\n## QuickTime 7\n\nI like the [HD trailers]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/quicktime/hdgallery/\" %}}) made possible by the new H.264 format, but other than that it seems to be the same as every other QuickTime release since 3.0. ## Address Book and iCal 2. There aren’t enough good things I can say about iCal, and Address Book has always been a helpful utility. Now you can add birthdays from the Address Book to iCal automatically, which is helpful. I used to sync my calendars to a PHPiCalendar installation, but that doesn’t seem to be working for me anymore for some reason.\n\nAddress Book now supports Smart Groups which I’m currently using to let me know who has a birthday coming up in the next month. I’m sure I’ll do more with it in time, I just haven’t yet.\n\n## Overall System Performance\n\nThe Tiger feels a bit snappier than Panther did… at least when running Apple applications. Most of the other apps feel about the same, but I’m sure newer versions will be faster as they’re built using Tiger API’s and such.\n\n## Other Stuff\n\nApple lists [over 200 new features]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/macosx/newfeatures/over200.html\" %}}) on the Tiger site — some of which I’ve played with and others I’ve not. Many of them aren’t particularly news-worthy though.\n\n## Problems So Far\n\nThere are a few quirks that I’ve run into thus far. Hopefully they’ll be fixed in 10.4.1 due out soon.\n\n## New ClamAV User\n\nFor some reason, I now have a second user listed on my login screen (I’m only supposed to have one). The name is `clamav`, which is the name of some open-source antivirus software being bundled with Tiger Server (no, I don’t have Tiger Server… just Tiger). However, I did have the ClamAV software installed prior to upgrading to Tiger.\n\nVisiting the [ClamAV FAQ]({{% wayback \"http://www.clamav.net/faq.html\" %}}), I see the following:\n\n\u003e **How do I remove the clamav account from my MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?**\n\u003e\n\u003e The clamav user was set up by Apple and we don’t know anything about it.\n\u003e\n\u003e **What is the password for the clamav user on MacOSX server 10.4 (Tiger)?**\n\u003e\n\u003e The clamav user was set up by Apple who has not told us the password they use, please contact Apple support for help. You may find that sudo password clamav in a terminal session helps to change the password, however we cannot support the option.\n\n## Windows SMB Sharing:\n\nI can still connect to my Windows shares by typing in the IP address, but using the browse utility causes Finder to hang and crash. That’s no good.\n\n## My Menubar Clock is in the Wrong Place:\n\nMinor annoyance, but annoying nonetheless.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/img/tiger_menubar.png\" alt=\"Tiger Menubar\"\u003e}}\n\n## Wrap Up\n\nSo that’s it! Overall my experience has been pretty positive. If you haven’t upgraded yet, and features like Spotlight and Dashboard aren’t compelling enough to upgrade at the moment, I’d say to wait until 10.4.1 or 10.4.2 comes out. Don’t get me wrong… you should definitely upgrade, but hopefully some of the minor quirks will be worked out in an upcoming point-release.\n"},
