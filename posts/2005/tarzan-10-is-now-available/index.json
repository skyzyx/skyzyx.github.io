Some webhosts have limits on how much memory a process can use (like the webhost for Skyzyx.com, iPowerWeb). In this case, the new clear_memory() function is helpful. This allows you to unset() the value of an array node, particularly the product that you just finished processing. You can read more about this function in the Tarzan Documentation.\n",
