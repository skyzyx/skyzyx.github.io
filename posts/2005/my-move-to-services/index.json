There’s a free and a pay version. I’m using the free one right now, and at the moment, it’s all I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing that I absolutely hate is when someone changes the URL of their feed and either doesn’t say anything (really bad), or posts a message that says “hey, I changed my feed URL to this… update your bookmarks” or whatever (bad, but not as bad). I was guilty of this at one point long ago, but I never wanted to do this to anyone ever again because of how much it bothers me. So, Apache 301 redirects were the solution. If your service or feed reader supports 301 redirects, you’ll be in good shape whenever the old feed address finally goes away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it only bothers me, because I have to switch away from my feed reader to go login to Bloglines, then delete the old entry, and re-add the new entry. Then, I have to go into each feed reader I have (Feed Demon on 2 computers and NetNewsWire on 1), delete the old feed, then pull down the new feed. It’d be much easier if I could get 2-way syncronization across multiple products and services… but hey, what can I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there you have it. Both of the above-mentioned services are good, so I’d recommend looking into them.
