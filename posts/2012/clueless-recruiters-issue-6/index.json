        "source":"\n{{\u003cdescription\u003e}}\nWhat does Ryan do when the same recruiter keeps pinging him over and over despite all efforts to get removed from a recruiter’s mailing list? Find out in this week’s episode of \u003cem\u003eClueless Recruiters\u003c/em\u003e! (Cue theme music!)\n{{\u003c/description\u003e}}\n\n## Explanation\n\n{{% aside %}}\nThere are few things that technical people are more annoyed by than technical recruiters. A very large segment of the technical recruiting industry has made a bad name for the rest of their industry by relentlessly spamming technical professionals after having [not done their homework](/2011/11/05/how-to-make-technical-professionals-not-hate-your-guts-a-guide-for-technical-recruiters/).\n\nThese people hock job openings the same way that sleazy salesmen hock used cars. These recruiting companies need to radically change how they do business with the technical crowd, and the [Clueless Recruiters](/categories/clueless-recruiters/) series is an attempt to call out clueless technical recruiters who contact me for jobs that are clearly a terrible fit. Everything here is posted from *real* exchanges between myself and recruiters, entirely uncut. Enjoy!\n{{% /aside %}}\n\n## Abhishek Banerjee from SACC Inc. is a giant douchebag\n\nNormally, I will remove or otherwise censor the names and email addresses of the recruiter and the company that they work for. This allows us to focus on the idiocy of a large sampling of the technical recruiting industry and have a few laughs while we’re at it. But not this time.\n\nThis time, I’ve had enough of one technical recruiter in particular — Abhishek Banerjee from SACC Inc. Reps from SACC have been spamming me for *years*. Not just 1–2 years, but more like 5–7 years. They’ve been spamming me so long, that they still send emails to an address that I haven’t used since my domain name was `skyzyx.com`. Yeah, *that* long!\n\nI have asked Abhishek Banerjee from SACC Inc. to stop emailing me on **several** occasions. I’ve asked to unsubscribe. I’ve asked him to remove my information from his company database. I’ve asked him to never contact me again. I have done everything that I can think of to let this guy know that I don’t want him contacting me *at all*. But despite my efforts, this guy continues to send me completely irrelevant recruiting emails over and over and over again.\n\nSo now, I’m calling you out, Abhishek Banerjee from SACC Inc.\n\n## Recruiter Schlock\n\n\u003e Dear Ryan:\n\u003e\n\u003e Hi,\n\u003e\n\u003e If interested and available, pls. respond back asap.\n\nFOR THE ZILLIONTH TIME, STOP CONTACTING ME!
