        "source":"\nAs we lead-up to Christmas (and other holidays that I don’t personally celebrate), I thought I’d put together a list of a few of my favorite things — Mac apps top be specific. These are some of my favorite *music and video apps*.\n\n## [iTunes]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.com\" %}}), [iTunes Match]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/\" %}}), [Last.fm]({{% wayback \"http://www.last.fm/download\" %}}), [Spotify]({{% wayback \"http://www.spotify.com\" %}}) \u0026 [Tracks]({{% wayback \"http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/tracks\" %}})\n\nI’ve been using iTunes to manage my music since iTunes 4.1 came out for Windows in 2003. Prior to that, I had a folder of music organized alphabetically and used [Winamp]({{% wayback \"http://www.winamp.com\" %}}) for playback. (If you’re still doing that in 2012, I’m judging you.)\n\nI use iTunes to hold all of my music, movies, TV shows and digital books. With iTunes running on my home computer, I can stream all of my media to my Apple TV, iPads and iPhones, into every room of the house.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/favorite-apps/itunes-match.png\"\u003e}}\n\niTunes Match is awesome! If I’m walking through downtown Seattle and have my iPhone with me, I can listen to any song in my library. If I’m riding the bus to work, I can pull out my iPad, do some reading, and listen to any song in my library. If I get to work and open up iTunes, I can listen to any song in my library. It’s super-awesome!\n\nI use Last.fm to take my listening habits and make recommendations for new music that I might like.\n\nI’ve spent time with both [Rdio]({{% wayback \"http://rdio.com\" %}}) and Spotify, and I ended up settling on Spotify as a way to supplement iTunes. I can check out entire albums before I decide to get them and put them into iTunes.

Mail and Calendar do a better job together than I’ve experienced with [Outlook]({{% wayback \"https://www.microsoft.com/mac/outlook\" %}}), [Thunderbird/Sunbird/Lightning]({{% wayback \"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/\" %}}), [Postbox]({{% wayback \"http://www.postbox-inc.com\" %}}), or even [Sparrow]({{% wayback \"http://www.sparrowmailapp.com\" %}}).\n\nI used to be a big fan of [Adium]({{% wayback \"http://adium.im\" %}}), but as my needs have changed, Adium hasn’t kept up. I spend more time texting over iMessage than I do IM-ing, and Adium still doesn’t have support for audio/video conversations.\n\nAlso, Messages now supports AIM, Yahoo! and Jabber (Google Talk, Facebook Messenger) protocols, so I really have no reason to use anything else.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/favorite-apps/messages.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n## [Fantastical]({{% wayback \"http://flexibits.com/fantastical\" %}})\n\nFantastical is a handy utility for getting a quick view of my calendar from my menubar, and — combined with the [Dictation]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html#dictation\" %}}) support in Mountain Lion — I can easily open up Fantastical with a key command, tell it about an upcoming event, and I’m done. Calendar events sync across my devices over iCloud, so I just create the event and I’m done.\n\n## [1Password]({{% wayback \"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\" %}})\n\nI can’t remember how much harder my life was before the days of 1Password. I use it to store my browser passwords, my software serial numbers, my bank account information (for use with online order forms), store secure notes (the wi-fi password at work, the backup passwords for the secondary-authentication support enabled on my Google and Facebook accounts), social security numbers, etc. My life would be a whole lot worse without 1Password.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/favorite-apps/1password.png\"\u003e}}\n"},

Perhaps you’ve forgotten: I was a spotty teenager; I bought one of your cute little translucent iBooks. Slowly but surely I painted most parts of my technological life a bright shade of Apple. Let’s see: I’ve owned two iMacs, a number of iBooks, countless Macbooks (I’ve currently got two on the go, for some unknown reason), an iPhone for almost five years, an iPad since the very beginning; iPods, iPod touches, iPod nanos – I’ve had ‘em all.

When I went to the States a couple of years back I shelled out hundreds of dollars to ensure I wouldn’t be without an iPhone – even though I was back at college and wasn’t exactly rolling in it. And like so many of those who fall in love with you, soon enough I found myself working part-time as your best PR spokesman: I spent hours persuading all my friends to buy your stuff. I even wrote a blog about what made Apple such a dynamic, innovative and successful company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlog \u003cem\u003epost\u003c/em\u003e.

You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos.

When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use.

I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*facepalm*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, it’s spelled \u003cem\u003elightning\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out.

Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years.

But I’ll tell you: Moving my contacts and calendars to iCloud has been a very positive experience.

        "plain":"A recent editorial on Business Insider layer out a number of reasons why the author, Ed Conway, was “leaving Apple”. This is my response.\nSelf-Indulgent Weiner In his editorial, Ed Conway wrote:\n Dear Tim,\nThere’s no easy way to put this so I’ll just come right out with it. I’m leaving you. It’s been great (mostly) but it’s over.\nI figured the least I could do is to explain my decision in full – I like to think it might help protect you from nasty break-ups like this in the future.\n I can’t help but think of the “self-indulgent weiner” line delivered by Nicholas Cage as Memphis Raines in the movie Gone in Sixty Seconds.\nEd, you’re going to complain in an effort to get page views. You’re trolling the Apple/anti-Apple crowds to get attention. That, sir, makes you a whore.\nLong-time Apple user  I’ve been with you, with Apple I mean, for 13 years now – ever since 1999. Perhaps you’ve forgotten: I was a spotty teenager; I bought one of your cute little translucent iBooks. Slowly but surely I painted most parts of my technological life a bright shade of Apple. Let’s see: I’ve owned two iMacs, a number of iBooks, countless Macbooks (I’ve currently got two on the go, for some unknown reason), an iPhone for almost five years, an iPad since the very beginning; iPods, iPod touches, iPod nanos – I’ve had ‘em all. I even invested in an Apple TV and, wait for it, a G4 Power Mac Cube (yes, that was me!).\n So, you’ve been an Apple user for a long time. That’s awesome. It’s made your life better, hasn’t it?\n I’ll admit I became dependent on you – clingy, even. When I went to the States a couple of years back I shelled out hundreds of dollars to ensure I wouldn’t be without an iPhone – even though I was back at college and wasn’t exactly rolling in it. And like so many of those who fall in love with you, soon enough I found myself working part-time as your best PR spokesman: I spent hours persuading all my friends to buy your stuff. I even wrote a blog about what made Apple such a dynamic, innovative and successful company.\n Blog post. You wrote a blog post, you idiot. A “blog” is a collection of posts, not a single one. You don’t “write a blog”, you \u0026ldquo;write a blog post\u0026rdquo;.\nBut that’s neither here nor there. It simply gives me a baseline of your intelligence so that I know whether I can gear my language and logic up or down. Clearly, it’s down.\nThe hype  Like millions of others, I really believed the hype.\n Yes, because Apple’s success has been built on hype, and hype alone. (If you believe this, then I have some ocean-front property in Arizona to sell you.)\nApple builds some of the fastest, thinnest and lightest computers with incredibly high build quality. The ones with some of the best displays (in terms of resolution (2880x1800), pixel density (326ppi) and color accuracy), best resale value, and have the highest consumer rating. They’re #1 in U.S. unit share for notebooks (Mac) (née laptops), and #1 in worldwide unit share for tablets (iPads).\nThe’ve created not one, but two of the most user-friendly consumer operating systems on the market. They redefined not only one, not even two, but three separate industries. And all of their devices work seamlessly together to create a really fantastic experience.\nBut no, it’s just hype.\nMore uninformed stupidity  I never thought I would utter these words, but here goes: I’m leaving you. I have already traded in my iPhone for a Samsung.\n A Samsung. One whole Samsung. *facepalm*\n Now, I know you don’t like lists (at least I presume that’s why you avoided including a task application in Mac OS and iOS for so many years) but it’s only right that I run through the issues:\n There has been a task manager in Mac OS (classic) as far back as System 1.0, AFAICT. Mac OS X has had a task manager since back in the NeXTStep days (1990’s). iOS didn’t support multitasking until iOS 4 (2010), and even then has chosen not to allow rampant or unchecked multitasking for user experience and battery life reasons. Every single detail about your last paragraph was 100% incorrect.\niOS 6  Yes, I know I’m hardly the first to mention this – but that doesn’t make it any less valid as a complaint. It is truly, truly awful. I’m usually ready to forgive one or two niggles in a new iteration of operating system. After all, they’re usually outweighed by the improvements. In this case, I honestly can’t think of a single new feature that in any way enhances the phone. Every change you’ve made is negative.\n There are zero features of iOS 6 that are positive? So then you must think that every single one of these features is a bad thing.\n  User must confirm access to Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos and Location Data when an app requests them.\n  It’s easy to keep contact information up-to-date with Facebook integration.\n  Asynchronous Game Center integration which allows for fantastic games like Letterpress to exist.\n  Built-in turn-by-turn navigation. 3D flyover views in Maps.\n  Siri has been improved, supports more types of information, and is available on more devices.\n  Facebook and Twitter notifications at the OS-level.\n  Shared photo streams (accessible to everyone, not just Facebook users).\n  The immensely-useful Passbook allows me to start keeping track of gift cards, tickets and other things without having to keep them in my wallet.\n  FaceTime conversations over cellular (3G, 4G and LTE).\n  Faster JavaScript, and improved CSS 3 and HTML 5 support in Safari.\n  The ability to decline calls (regardless of which view you’re in) then send the caller a message instead if you can’t talk right now.\n  Do Not Disturb settings for all of those overnight notifications, texts and drunken phone calls.\n  Automatic syncing of tabs between Safari on Mac/iPhone/iPad over iCloud.\n  Further-improved accessibility settings for people who need them.\n   The maps application is utterly horrendous; you must have known this is among the most commonly-used of all functional parts of a smartphone and that to change it quite so substantially would be seriously disruptive.\n The new Apple-powered (instead of Google-powered) Maps app has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Maps load faster (thanks to vector-based rendering), I get turn-by-turn directions with voiceover for free (this used to cost $50 for a third-party app), and the 3D “flyover” view has allowed me to discover a bunch of cool things in downtown Seattle that I never knew existed.\nThe only “loss” I experienced was transit maps. This forced me to discover a number of transit mapping applications that are way better than what I used to use Google Maps in iOS for. Two apps that I use frequently are OneBusAway and Lumatic City Maps. In a pinch, I can use Google Transit Maps in Safari.\n Take iTunes Match. In the previous iOS I could download any individual song in my iTunes Match library, so I could listen to it overseas without data or when in the Tube. Now your dreadful new operating system will only let me download whole albums […]\n This is partially false. I use iTunes Match all the time. Yes, they’ve removed the one-by-one icons for downloading individual songs. This is a little disappointing, but not super disappointing. I often use playlists (including Smart Playlists) in iTunes, so it’s pretty easy for me to add a song that I want to a playlist, then sync down that playlist.\n […] and then won’t let me delete them afterwards, so my iPhone gets clogged up with stuff before arbitrarily deleting precious chunks of data when it reaches capacity.\n Not true, but deleting songs is more complicated as you need to turn off iTunes Match, then manually delete individual songs one-by-one from the list view.\nThis argument is less moronic than the others… so far.\n As do I find the fact that you now seem to have decided to allow the iOS to decide unilaterally to use the telephone network rather than wifi when it so chooses.\n What? I have no idea what you’re talking about here.\n Given how badly you screwed up with the whole secret GPS-tracking of iPhone users, I’d have thought you realised we don’t like it when you behave creepily like this. It’s seriously not cool, but then more on that later.\n Oh, you mean how the complete opposite of your statement is the truth?\n All the new, exciting apps you’ve brought in are, I’m afraid to say, rubbish.\n Let’s take a look.\n Podcasts: dismal and buggy.\n Yes, Podcasts 1.0 was a terrible app. But we’re no longer talking about iOS 6.\n Facebook integration: should have been there years ago.\n Apple gave you what you wanted, and now you’re complaining.\n Passbook: erm – seriously?\n One of my favorite additions, actually. I use it frequently.\n Siri’s improvements are lost on me because, like most users, the only time I’ve engaged with Siri is to see how many swear words he/she/it understands (answer: a surprising number).\n I’ll now have to take back my not-so-moronic statement about you that I made earlier.\n Finally, for some reason iOS also seems to have broken the tilt-scrolling in Instapaper, which I resent because, well, I just use that app a lot.\n So do I. And it works. Or were you using the iOS 6 Beta which was in, you know, beta status?\nYou’ve lost it  This is going to sound awful, but I can’t think of any big product you’ve re-imagined well since the iPad, and that was almost three years ago.\n Stupidity should be painful. It seems as though Ed believes that if things don’t change radically from one iteration to the next, then they suck. Dude, take your Ritalin and calm your ADHD-ass the **** down.\n iCloud? Not as good as dropbox, and actually more confusing. FaceTime? Slick, but still pales in comparison with Skype. iMessages? Mostly annoying, particularly when it sends messages twice. Siri? See the previous point. Safari? Not as good as Chrome or Firefox. Safari’s Reader function? Not as good as Instapaper. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\n Apple has been doing this for a while, so I’m surprised that Ed — a 13-year Apple veteran — hasn’t been paying attention.\nApple does not try to replace existing apps and functionality. Rather, it seeks to chase them up the bean pole. In other words, Apple comes in to the entry level of the market (informing some people that such a market exists in the first place), and challenges the incumbents to provide mid- and advanced-level features for people who want more.\n  iCloud: Handles your fundamental syncing tasks across devices with zero effort.\n  FaceTime: Always-on. Just tap the contact info of a friend or family member with a Mac, iPhone or iPad, and the call begins. No signing up. No ads. Simple.\n  iMessages: I can send and receive messages to other Mac/iPhone/iPad users from my Mac/iPhone/iPad. Messages sync across all devices so I never have to wonder where they went.\n  Siri: Fantastic. Easy to send text messages to people via voice while I’m driving. Easy to look up turn-by-turn directions. Easy to find a list of nearby Thai restaurants, with user-submitted reviews, ratings and price information.\n  Safari: Safari is incredibly fast on Mac and iOS. It’s become my preferred browser over both Chrome and Firefox because of this.\n  Safari’s Reader function: Most people don’t realize that you can read websites with all of the ads and crap stripped out of them. Instapaper led the charge, but Pocket is also coming along. Safari Reader is an entry-level feature.\n   Plus, my Mac simply doesn’t work that well any more. The contacts on my iPhone don’t seem to sync very well with my laptop. Aperture is extraordinarily slow and buggy, Pages and Numbers are a bit of a nonsense. It just feels like you don’t make the best software anymore. And it doesn’t fit together as seamlessly as in the past.\n SOMETHING IS WRONG! FIX IT! MAKE IT WORK!\nI don’t have any of the technical problems Ed’s talking about (e.g., contact syncing). I like Pages, but I prefer to write in Markdown using iA Writer. I have no need for Numbers. Since all of Ed’s assertions are unqualified and he fails to explain anything, it’s clear that he’s just ranting about things he doesn’t (or hasn’t taken the time to) understand.\nYou’re not cool anymore  Again, this is probably a body blow, but it’s also true. It’s not merely that I now have to put up with your products being used by my mother. The fact is that Apple used to be edgy; it used to be associated with the counterculture; it used to be rebellious. I liked that. I liked the fact that you were uncompromising. […]\n Yes, and Apple also almost went bankrupt in 1996. They were rebels without a clue. Now they’re wildly successful because they chose not to follow in the footsteps of other companies… and you’re mad?\n When you introduced the iMac you ditched the serial ports and insisted everyone had to make do with USB ports, despite the fact there was approximately one printer in the world which worked with USB. You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos. There was something cool about that attitude.\n None… (reading…) yep, none of those things have changed.\n These days, you’re all too ready to compromise. Do you want to know the beginning of the end of our relationship? It was when you decided to include an SD slot in your MacBooks. Why? I can’t imagine the Apple of old ever doing this; there is no inherent reason why you need one in your laptop, save to compromise. And in compromising, you’ve become too complex.\n User research showed that lots and lots of people were using SD cards in their cameras and other devices, so Apple added an SD card reader into their laptops. Apple did what made things simpler for users.\n I remember the first iMac: it was the first computer you didn’t really need an instruction manual for. When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use. That’s the first time I’ve ever had to use an Apple instruction manual.\n You swipe. You tap. If you want to check out the settings, you tap on “Settings”. It’s really not complex. Both my son and my daughter (elementary school age) were able to pick up my iPhone (and later my iPad) and begin using them immediately with zero instruction.\nWhat does that say about you, Ed?\n Apple used to be about purity, which in turn made its products simpler and more reliable; somewhere along the way, this got lost. Or rather, Apple under Steve Jobs used to be about purity: when he wasn’t at the helm in the 90s, it also made the kind of compromises I’m talking about here.\n By “compromise”, Ed means “gave customers what they were asking for”.\nYou’re screwing us  No: the final straw was when you decided to replace the dock on the bottom of all your iPhones and iPads with the new “lightening dock”. I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\n *facepalm*\n You’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\n Firstly, it’s spelled lightning.\nSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out. But it’s also because you can spend $29 on a converter.\nMy chargers are all USB chargers, so I was able to plug the new USB-based Lightning connector in where my old USB-based 30-pin connector was. Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\nLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\n Anyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\n Again, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\nThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years. This is in stark contrast to Android-based devices which are lucky to see a single update ever.\nMacs tend to be supported with the latest updates for 5–6+ years. The latest OS X release, Mountain Lion, supports 2007-era and newer Macs. Considering that the earliest possible Macs that they could support are the first Intel-based Macs (released in 2006), this is pretty darn good.\nI don’t need you any more  I was between iPhones and I filled the lonely miserable gap with an HTC Android phone. And while I tried to ignore it at the time, the fact is, it was actually pretty good. Yes, there were niggles and a few annoyances, but we got along surprisingly well. And I’ll get on pretty well with it again, because the fact is, Tim: I’m leaving you for an Android. I can get everything I need from a phone from them as well.\n Oh, you’re only looking for a phone? Well hey, knock yourself out.\nLast year, I wrote about why Apple’s ecosystem is unmatched and how Android still has a long way to go. If you just want a phone that does some smartphone-like stuff, Android is just fine.\n My email, my messages, maps that work, my contacts (they’re stored with Google anyway and that integrates far better into an Android phone); Evernote, Instapaper, Whatsapp, my tube timetables and bus times. I’ll probably ditch iTunes Match in favour of Amazon Cloud Player or Google Drive, and, frankly, good riddance after the way you’ve treated us mobile users of the service. I’ll miss some of the apps, I’m sure – Reeder to name just one. I’ll miss the hundreds of text messages sitting on my iPhone. I’ll miss… Actually, I can’t think of anything else right now.\n If you’re invested in the Google platform for your contacts, calendars and email, then the Google mobile OS might be a good fit for you. I used Google for contacts and calendars for 4 years and have used Google for email since I got into the Gmail beta in May 2004. But I’ll tell you: Moving my contacts and calendars to iCloud has been a very positive experience. Not only does contact syncing over iCloud work better, but sharing calendars with other people allows for notifications about changes for all people involved. I couldn’t get this with Google Calendar.\nI’ve used Amazon Cloud Player on Android 4.0.4 (CyanogenMod 9) and iOS, and quite frankly, it sucks. It crashes often, it doesn’t use my album artwork, and it only supports the popular-but-inefficient MP3 audio codec. It also doesn’t integrate with iTunes on my Mac. DoubleTwist is tolerable, but the integration isn’t as good there either.\nGoogle Music still requires you to upload all of your music. I have hundreds of gigabytes, so that simply isn’t going to happen.\n I’ll hang onto my iPad for the time being. I’ll certainly keep the Macbook Air – I’m not quite ready to return to Windows yet.\n Might not buy a Mac, but not ready to go back to Windows? Where else is there to go? Desktop Linux?\n Don’t take it personally. Well, do, if it helps inspire you to make better and bolder products. This need not be forever. You can still win me back: but you’ll need to do something special again, like you did in the good old days. Reinvent the TV, like you reinvented the phone. Revolutionise finance. Overhaul the home entirely. Think Different – as your predecessor Steve Jobs used to say. Perhaps the problem is you’re not the same person any more. You’re not Steve. Perhaps.\n Reinventing TV takes time. You can’t just take an ancient, out-of-touch industry and change it overnight. Apple took 10 years to build out a successful media platform and top-notch mobile devices.\nIt’s nice that you want Apple do revolutionize everything, but understand that Apple is a business and they need to have the right motivation and opportunity before they can tackle a new market.\nAnd by mentioning Steve, your ignorance is showing. Moron.\n Either way, I’m tired of settling for mediocrity from you these days.\n Some of the best made, best selling products of all time. Blockbuster, record-breaking sales around the world. But because Apple is continuing to hone their skills and continually improve their products over time, they’ve become mediocre.\nAgain, go find your Ritalin and settle your ADHD-ass the **** down.\nConclusion So, Ed, let me get this straight.\n You like your MacBook Air and you don’t want to go back to Windows. You like your iPad (that presumably has iOS 6, and you didn’t mention how anemic the Android tablet market/experience is). You’re frustrated that the tech bloggers complained loudly about Maps and iCloud, even though both work really well. You complain about Apple not supporting their devices, then say you’re going to move to Android. You want Apple to reinvent everything, ever. But they haven’t, so they suck. You want Apple to introduce radical changes to their devices, but complain loudly when they change their mapping provider or introduce a new dock connector.  You, sir, are clearly the king of the morons. Congratulations.\n",

In this case, I honestly can’t think of a single new feature that in any way enhances the phone. Every change you’ve made is negative.\n\nThere are *zero* features of iOS 6 that are positive? So then you must think that [every]({{% wayback \"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-6_0/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012166\" %}}) [single]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/\" %}}) one of these features is a bad thing.\n\n* User must confirm access to Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Photos and Location Data when an app requests them.\n\n* It’s easy to keep contact information up-to-date with Facebook integration.\n\n* Asynchronous Game Center integration which allows for fantastic games like [Letterpress]({{% wayback \"http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/\" %}}) to exist.\n\n* Built-in turn-by-turn navigation. 3D flyover views in Maps.\n\n* Siri has been improved, supports more types of information, and is available on more devices.\n\n* Facebook and Twitter notifications at the OS-level.\n\n* Shared photo streams (accessible to everyone, not just Facebook users).\n\n* The immensely-useful Passbook allows me to start keeping track of gift cards, tickets and other things without having to keep them in my wallet.\n\n* FaceTime conversations over cellular (3G, 4G and LTE).\n\n* Faster JavaScript, and improved CSS 3 and HTML 5 support in Safari.\n\n* The ability to decline calls (regardless of which view you’re in) then send the caller a message instead if you can’t talk right now.\n\n* Do Not Disturb settings for all of those overnight notifications, texts and drunken phone calls.\n\n* Automatic syncing of tabs between Safari on Mac/iPhone/iPad over iCloud.\n\n* Further-improved accessibility settings for people who need them.\n\n\u003e The maps application is utterly horrendous; you must have known this is among the most commonly-used of all functional parts of a smartphone and that to change it quite so substantially would be seriously disruptive.\n\nThe new Apple-powered (instead of Google-powered) Maps app has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Maps load faster (thanks to vector-based rendering), I get turn-by-turn directions with voiceover for free (this used to cost $50 for a third-party app), and the 3D “flyover” view has allowed me to discover a bunch of cool things in downtown Seattle that I never knew existed.\n\nThe only “loss” I experienced was transit maps. This forced me to discover a number of transit mapping applications that are *way* better than what I used to use Google Maps in iOS for. Two apps that I use frequently are [OneBusAway]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onebusaway/id329380089?mt=8\" %}}) and [Lumatic City Maps]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumatic-city-maps/id501673331?mt=8\" %}}). In a pinch, I can use Google Transit Maps in Safari.\n\n\u003e Take iTunes Match. In the previous iOS I could download any individual song in my iTunes Match library, so I could listen to it overseas without data or when in the Tube. Now your dreadful new operating system will only let me download whole albums \\[…\\]\n\nThis is partially false. I use iTunes Match *all the time*. Yes, they’ve removed the one-by-one icons for downloading individual songs. This is a little disappointing, but not super disappointing. I often use playlists (including Smart Playlists) in iTunes, so it’s pretty easy for me to add a song that I want to a playlist, then sync down that playlist.\n\n\u003e \\[…\\] and then won’t let me delete them afterwards, so my iPhone gets clogged up with stuff before arbitrarily deleting precious chunks of data when it reaches capacity.\n\nNot true, but deleting songs is more complicated as you need to turn off iTunes Match, then manually delete individual songs one-by-one from the list view.\n\nThis argument is less moronic than the others… so far.\n\n\u003e As do I find the fact that you now seem to have decided to allow the iOS to decide unilaterally to use the telephone network rather than wifi when it so chooses.\n\nWhat? I have no idea what you’re talking about here.\n\n\u003e Given how badly you screwed up with the whole secret GPS-tracking of iPhone users, I’d have thought you realised we don’t like it when you behave creepily like this. It’s seriously not cool, but then more on that later.\n\nOh, you mean how the [*complete opposite* of your statement is the truth]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html\" %}})?\n\n\u003e All the new, exciting apps you’ve brought in are, I’m afraid to say, rubbish.\n\nLet’s take a look.\n\n\u003e Podcasts: dismal and buggy.\n\nYes, Podcasts 1.0 was a terrible app. But we’re no longer talking about iOS 6.\n\n\u003e Facebook integration: should have been there years ago.\n\nApple gave you what you wanted, and now you’re complaining.\n\n\u003e Passbook: erm – seriously?\n\nOne of my favorite additions, actually. I use it frequently.\n\n\u003e Siri’s improvements are lost on me because, like most users, the only time I’ve engaged with Siri is to see how many swear words he/she/it understands (answer: a surprising number).\n\nI’ll now have to take back my not-so-moronic statement about you that I made earlier.\n\n\u003e Finally, for some reason iOS also seems to have broken the tilt-scrolling in Instapaper, which I resent because, well, I just use that app a lot.\n\nSo do I. And it works. Or were you using the iOS 6 Beta which was in, you know, *beta* status?\n\n## You’ve lost it\n\n\u003e This is going to sound awful, but I can’t think of any big product you’ve re-imagined well since the iPad, and that was almost three years ago.\n\nStupidity should be painful. It seems as though Ed believes that if things don’t change radically from one iteration to the next, then they suck. Dude, take your Ritalin and calm your ADHD-ass the \\*\\*\\*\\* down.\n\n\u003e iCloud? Not as good as dropbox, and actually more confusing. FaceTime? Slick, but still pales in comparison with Skype. iMessages? Mostly annoying, particularly when it sends messages twice. Siri? See the previous point. Safari? Not as good as Chrome or Firefox. Safari’s Reader function? Not as good as Instapaper. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.\n\nApple has been doing this for a while, so I’m surprised that Ed — a 13-year Apple veteran — hasn’t been paying attention.\n\nApple does not try to *replace* existing apps and functionality. Rather, it seeks to chase them up the bean pole. In other words, Apple comes in to the entry level of the market (informing some people that such a market exists in the first place), and challenges the incumbents to provide mid- and advanced-level features for people who want more.\n\n* iCloud: Handles your fundamental syncing tasks across devices with zero effort.\n\n* FaceTime: Always-on. Just tap the contact info of a friend or family member with a Mac, iPhone or iPad, and the call begins. No signing up. No ads. Simple.\n\n* iMessages: I can send and receive messages to other Mac/iPhone/iPad users from my Mac/iPhone/iPad. Messages sync across all devices so I never have to wonder where they went.\n\n* Siri: Fantastic. Easy to send text messages to people via voice while I’m driving. Easy to look up turn-by-turn directions. Easy to find a list of nearby Thai restaurants, with user-submitted reviews, ratings and price information.\n\n* Safari: Safari is incredibly fast on Mac and iOS. It’s become my preferred browser over both Chrome and Firefox because of this.\n\n* Safari’s Reader function: Most people don’t realize that you can read websites with all of the ads and crap stripped out of them. Instapaper led the charge, but Pocket is also coming along. Safari Reader is an entry-level feature.\n\n\u003e Plus, my Mac simply doesn’t work that well any more. The contacts on my iPhone don’t seem to sync very well with my laptop. Aperture is extraordinarily slow and buggy, Pages and Numbers are a bit of a nonsense. It just feels like you don’t make the best software anymore. And it doesn’t fit together as seamlessly as in the past.\n\nSOMETHING IS WRONG! FIX IT! MAKE IT WORK!\n\nI don’t have any of the technical problems Ed’s talking about (e.g., contact syncing). I like Pages, but I prefer to write in Markdown using [iA Writer]({{% wayback \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12\" %}}). I have no need for Numbers. Since all of Ed’s assertions are unqualified and he fails to explain anything, it’s clear that he’s just ranting about things he doesn’t (or hasn’t taken the time to) understand.\n\n## You’re not cool anymore\n\n\u003e Again, this is probably a body blow, but it’s also true. It’s not merely that I now have to put up with your products being used by my mother. The fact is that Apple used to be edgy; it used to be associated with the counterculture; it used to be rebellious. I liked that. I liked the fact that you were uncompromising. \\[…\\]\n\nYes, and Apple also almost went bankrupt in 1996. They were rebels without a clue. Now they’re wildly successful because they chose *not* to follow in the footsteps of other companies… and you’re *mad?*\n\n\u003e When you introduced the iMac you ditched the serial ports and insisted everyone had to make do with USB ports, despite the fact there was approximately one printer in the world which worked with USB. You were the first to ditch disc drives and DVD drives. I’m not alone but I liked the way you refused to put Flash on your devices. Plus I liked the fact that unlike Google and pretty much every other big company you and your fellow execs would never go to navel-gazing networking conferences like the World Economic Forum in Davos. There was something cool about that attitude.\n\nNone… (reading…) yep, none of those things have changed.\n\n\u003e These days, you’re all too ready to compromise. Do you want to know the beginning of the end of our relationship? It was when you decided to include an SD slot in your MacBooks. Why? I can’t imagine the Apple of old ever doing this; there is no inherent reason why you need one in your laptop, save to compromise. And in compromising, you’ve become too complex.\n\nUser research showed that lots and lots of people were using SD cards in their cameras and other devices, so Apple added an SD card reader into their laptops. Apple did what made things *simpler* for users.\n\n\u003e I remember the first iMac: it was the first computer you didn’t really need an instruction manual for. When iOS came out I found myself having to download the manual and wade through its 156 pages (156, FFS Tim!) to find out what you’d done with the settings I used to use. That’s the first time I’ve ever had to use an Apple instruction manual.\n\nYou swipe. You tap. If you want to check out the settings, you tap on “Settings”. It’s really not complex. Both my son and my daughter (elementary school age) were able to pick up my iPhone (and later my iPad) and begin using them *immediately* with zero instruction.\n\nWhat does that say about you, Ed?\n\n\u003e Apple used to be about purity, which in turn made its products simpler and more reliable; somewhere along the way, this got lost. Or rather, Apple under Steve Jobs used to be about purity: when he wasn’t at the helm in the 90s, it also made the kind of compromises I’m talking about here.\n\nBy “compromise”, Ed means “gave customers what they were asking for”.\n\n## You’re screwing us\n\n\u003e No: the final straw was when you decided to replace the dock on the bottom of all your iPhones and iPads with the new “lightening dock”. I’ve heard your explanations: that it’ll allow your devices to be thinner, that it’s a faster connector and all that. I don’t buy it. The main reason you did this is the main reason you seem to be bringing your products out in ever shorter product cycles: planned obsolescence.\n\n\\*facepalm\\*\n\n\u003e You’re aware that the more frequently something is out-of-date, the more often we’ll have to buy more Apple stuff. Now, I was willing to put up with that when it felt as if there was genuinely progress between iterations, when there was a shred of aspiration about it, but by the time you unveiled the lightening connector I wasn’t so sure. All it means is that I have to throw out all the devices I’ve bought over the past years which plug into my iPhone: adaptors, radios, speakers and so on. It’s a really low-down thing to do – particularly since the lightening connector is patently not that much faster than the existing dock.\n\nFirstly, it’s spelled *lightning*.\n\nSecondly, I haven’t thrown out a single device I’ve purchased since 2003 when the 30-pin dock was introduced. This is mainly because I’m not a moron who goes around throwing things out. But it’s also because you can spend [$29 on a converter]({{% wayback \"http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD823/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter\" %}}).\n\nMy chargers are all USB chargers, so I was able to plug the new USB-based Lightning connector in where my old USB-based 30-pin connector was. Yes, I’ve invested a grand total of about $60 buying multiple USB-to-Lightning cables so that I have one for my car, my office, and my home, but considering how many years it’s been since I had to buy a cable, I’m not that stressed about it.\n\nLastly, Apple has said that Lightning will be the standard for “at least the next 10 years” (as per Phil Schiller). With all of Apple’s new Macs supporting USB 3.0, I’d wager a very healthy sum of money on Lightning supporting USB 3.0 speeds. It also allows the devices to become even thinner and lighter over time. This is A Good Thing™.\n\n\u003e Anyway, I guess you could say it was a Eureka moment. Finally, I realised that you’ve been working your way here for years: the fact that you give up supporting old Macs far quicker than before; that you won’t let us download and delete our own music from your cloud. You realise there isn’t much money long-term in being a pure manufacturer. You want to turn yourself into a quasi-service, where we constantly need to buy or subscribe to one of your products. I see the point – it’s economic genius. The problem is that it’s not inspiring in the slightest; and the products are no longer wowing us enough to detract from the venality of it. And I’m just tired and, worse, bored of it.\n\nAgain, 100% of this statement is complete fiction.\n\nThus far, iOS devices (with the notable exception of the first-generation iPad) have received the latest OS updates for 3+ years. This is in stark contrast to Android-based devices which are lucky to see a single update *ever*.\n\nMacs tend to be supported with the latest updates for 5–6+ years. The latest OS X release, Mountain Lion, supports 2007-era and newer Macs. Considering that the earliest possible Macs that they could support are the first Intel-based Macs (released in 2006), this is pretty darn good.\n\n## I don’t need you any more\n\n\u003e I was between iPhones and I filled the lonely miserable gap with an HTC Android phone. And while I tried to ignore it at the time, the fact is, it was actually pretty good. Yes, there were niggles and a few annoyances, but we got along surprisingly well. And I’ll get on pretty well with it again, because the fact is, Tim: I’m leaving you for an Android. I can get everything I need from a phone from them as well.\n\nOh, you’re *only* looking for a phone? Well hey, knock yourself out.\n\nLast year, [I wrote about why Apple’s ecosystem is unmatched](/2011/09/05/skating-to-where-the-puck-will-be/) and how Android still has a long way to go. If you just want a phone that does some smartphone-like stuff, Android is just fine.\n\n\u003e My email, my messages, maps that work, my contacts (they’re stored with Google anyway and that integrates far better into an Android phone); Evernote, Instapaper, Whatsapp, my tube timetables and bus times. I’ll probably ditch iTunes Match in favour of Amazon Cloud Player or Google Drive, and, frankly, good riddance after the way you’ve treated us mobile users of the service. I’ll miss some of the apps, I’m sure – Reeder to name just one. I’ll miss the hundreds of text messages sitting on my iPhone. I’ll miss… Actually, I can’t think of anything else right now.\n\nIf you’re invested in the Google platform for your contacts, calendars and email, then the Google mobile OS might be a good fit for you. I used Google for contacts and calendars for 4 years and have used Google for email since I got into the Gmail beta in May 2004. But I’ll tell you: Moving my contacts and calendars to iCloud has been a very positive experience. Not only does contact syncing over iCloud work better, but sharing calendars with other people allows for notifications about changes for all people involved. I couldn’t get this with Google Calendar.\n\nI’ve used Amazon Cloud Player on Android 4.0.4 (CyanogenMod 9) and iOS, and quite frankly, it sucks. It crashes often, it doesn’t use *my* album artwork, and it only supports the popular-but-inefficient MP3 audio codec. It also doesn’t integrate with iTunes on my Mac. [DoubleTwist]({{% wayback \"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer\" %}}) is tolerable, but the integration isn’t as good there either.\n\nGoogle Music still requires you to upload all of your music. I have hundreds of gigabytes, so that simply isn’t going to happen.\n\n\u003e I’ll hang onto my iPad for the time being. I’ll certainly keep the Macbook Air – I’m not quite ready to return to Windows yet.\n\nMight not buy a Mac, but not ready to go back to Windows? Where else is there to go? Desktop Linux?\n\n\u003e Don’t take it personally. Well, do, if it helps inspire you to make better and bolder products. This need not be forever. You can still win me back: but you’ll need to do something special again, like you did in the good old days. Reinvent the TV, like you reinvented the phone. Revolutionise finance. Overhaul the home entirely. Think Different – as your predecessor Steve Jobs used to say. Perhaps the problem is you’re not the same person any more. You’re not Steve. Perhaps.\n\nReinventing TV takes time. You can’t just take an ancient, out-of-touch industry and change it overnight. Apple took 10 years to build out a successful media platform and top-notch mobile devices.\n\nIt’s nice that you want Apple do revolutionize *everything*, but understand that Apple is a business and they need to have the right motivation and opportunity before they can tackle a new market.\n\nAnd by mentioning Steve, your ignorance is showing. Moron.\n\n\u003e Either way, I’m tired of settling for mediocrity from you these days.\n\nSome of the best made, best selling products of all time. Blockbuster, record-breaking sales around the world. But because Apple is continuing to hone their skills and continually improve their products over time, they’ve become mediocre.\n\nAgain, go find your Ritalin and settle your ADHD-ass the \\*\\*\\*\\* down.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo, Ed, let me get this straight.\n\n* You like your MacBook Air and you don’t want to go back to Windows.\n* You like your iPad (that presumably has iOS 6, and you didn’t mention how anemic the Android tablet market/experience is).\n* You’re frustrated that the tech bloggers complained loudly about Maps and iCloud, even though both work really well.\n* You complain about Apple not supporting their devices, then say you’re going to move to *Android*.\n* You want Apple to reinvent *everything, ever*. But they haven’t, so they suck.\n* You want Apple to introduce radical changes to their devices, but complain loudly when they change their mapping provider or introduce a new dock connector.\n\nYou, sir, are clearly the king of the morons. Congratulations.\n"},

Lately, however, I’ve noticed some saddeningly ill-informed “reporting” when it comes to Apple, iOS 6 and the new iPhone 5.\nBias is bias First of all, everybody is free to have their own opinions. If these guys prefer Android-based OSs and non-Apple hardware, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you’re in the business of reporting information, however, make sure you have your facts straight and aren’t misleading anybody by leaving out relevant information.\nAnything less than that is simply sloppy reporting.\n“Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs” In the recent episode entitled Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs, Mauricio Balvanera (producer) and Jackie Talbott (host) compare the new Apple iPhone 5 to the Samsung Galaxy S III in a number of factors. Here are some highlights:\nBeing pedantic First of all — and yes, I understand how completely pedantic I’m being — let’s break-down the accuracy of the title of the episode: “Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs”.\n  Apple is a company, which makes both the phone hardware, as well as the phone software.\n  Android is a base operating system, which hardware vendors take, modify, and re-release as their own custom operating systems. Android is built primarily by Google.\n  iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III are both (hardware) phones made by Apple and Samsung, respectively.\n Apple’s iPhone 5 runs iOS Samsung’s Galaxy S III runs Samsung’s modified version of the base Android OS. I have no idea what the product name of their custom OS is.    This is just plain sloppy.\nLeapfrogged  Mauricio: So we’re going to go over the technical differences between the two and basically decide whether or not Apple has leapfrogged Android technology.\n Has it already been decided that iOS has been leapfrogged by Android? If so, I wasn’t aware that this decision had been made. There are several cases where Apple and iOS have left other devices and mobile platforms in the dust. Were these not taken into account when the decision was made that Android was ahead?\nDevice size  Mauricio: So, the S III obviously takes the cake on size, while the iPhone beats out the S3 on thinness […]\n Yes, the S3 is physically larger. Does that mean it “wins”? I would argue not, but Mauricio seems to imply that requiring two hands is a feature. The be fair, however, he and Jackie both made it a point to mention that it can all boil down to a matter of preference, so there is neither a winner nor a loser here. Although I think they could have done a better job addressing this up-front, I’ll let this one slide.\nWhat they didn’t talk about, however, was the weight. The iPhone 5 feels considerably lighter than both the glass-backed 4 and 4S models, and clocks in at 3.95 ounces (112 grams). The Galaxy S III clocks in at just over 4.69 ounces (133 grams).\nNow, I own an iPhone 4 which clocks in at 4.8 ounces (137 grams). Various co-workers of mine have iPhone 4Ss, which clock in at 4.9 ounces (140 grams). The new iPhone 5 is 28g lighter than the 4S, and 25g lighter than the 4, and the difference in your hand is substantial. It would be reasonable to infer that being 21g lighter than the Galaxy S III would be nearly equally substantial.\nCamera There was too much banter here for me to transcribe, but they basically compare 8 MP to 8 MP with 1080p recording for each, and leave it at that. What they completely leave out is the quality of the lense, the aperture, low-light boosting, etc., which really make or break the quality of the photographs.\nNow, I’m not going to pretend to be a photography buff who knows the difference from one aperture size to another, but what about providing real-world photographs comparing one device to another to see what the real-world differences are?\nAnd that’s only for still shots. What about the quality of the recorded video? 1080p is a shorthand reference for 1920-by–1080 resolution; this has nothing to do with quality. And what about things like image stabilization during recording? I know first-hand that the last couple of iPhones have had awesome image stabilization. How does the Galaxy S III stack up?\nLightning port First, Mauricio makes a comment about replacing the old proprietary dock for a new proprietary dock (*womp, womp*) — implying that proprietary is inherently bad. Mauricio’s bias is showing.\nMauricio follows that up by explaining that the Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) Forum chose to endorse Micro USB for power and data transport in 2007. He also added that Apple was “notably absent.”\nThis reminds me of the story about how Teddy Roosevelt’s own mother didn’t even vote for him! Why does the OMTP story remind me of Teddy Roosevelt’s mother? Because both statements are both true and entirely misleading. What Mauricio leaves out of his explanation are some additional facts:\n  The OMTP forum was a collection of for-profit corporations, and not an unbiased standards organization.\n  The OMTP existed from 2004–2010. It no longer exists.\n  Micro USB was selected for power and data transfer — because those are the only two things that Micro USB is capable of.\n Apple’s 30-pin and Lightning connectors support video-out. Apple’s 30-pin and Lightning connectors support controlling the iDevice from another device (including stereos and car adapters). Apple’s 30-pin and Lightning connectors wrap additional functionality around the base USB 2.0 implementation.    Teddy Roosevelt was elected before 1918, when the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed to allow women to vote.\n  USB is a “dumb” protocol, and requires the primary machine’s CPU for any data transfer. FireWire, the 30-pin and Lightning connectors are much more intelligent protocols which use an on-board device processor, allowing for more efficient data transfer than Micro USB does — even over the same USB 2.0 protocol. Most USB 2.0 devices are lucky to get 280 Mbps (35 MB/s) of real-world throughput.\nNow, although the current version of the cables come in the USB 2.0 variety, do we know if the iPhone 5’s connector is capable of newer protocols such as USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt? I don’t know what the answer is, but it seems to me that starting with USB 2.0 support makes the most sense because that’s what the overwhelming number of customers have available.\nDuring a teardown of the iPhone 5 (which, to be fair, didn’t happen until after this episode of App Judgment was recorded), Ars Technica points out that Lightning might be USB 3.0-compatible. If the Lightning connector is supposed to last us another 10 years (as claimed by Apple), this seems to make the most sense.\nThings that are missing  No Micro SD […]\n Yay, because:\n Micro SD is more than 10x slower than the built-in SSD drives, and… Having multiple drives attached would complicate the UX of the device.   No NFC (Boo!) […]\n Near-Field Communication (NFC) is still (arguably) a solution in search of a problem. It’s a cart-before-the-horse situation. If NFC really does unlock some fantastic uses that make my life easier/better in some way, by all means, show them to me. I’d love to be proven wrong.\nPhil Schiller explains the majority of use-cases that people want NFC to fit are addressed by Passbook. Passbook is still new and apps are few (iOS 6 was released to the public only 11 days ago), but being an all-software solution means that developers can deliver new features quickly without requiring third-parties to purchase and integrate new NFC hardware.\nLet’s see which way the real-world usage actually goes. Realistically, it’s simply too early to tell.\n No Barometer […]\n What? How useful would such a feature be in the real world, when weather apps are a dime a dozen? I have no idea why this was on the list, other than to be a kitchen sink item.\n And no wireless charging capabilities.\n This would be an interesting feature in theory, but I’m not convinced that I’d want a bulkier phone in exchange for this feature. Also, when I plug in my phone to charge, I also want it to sync. While the iTunes WiFi Syncing in iOS 5 and later addresses this, it’s more important to me to have a faster connection while transferring data — especially with movies, TV shows and games that are typically in the 500 MB–2 GB range.\nSo, I’d argue that it’s an interesting feature, but I don’t know how well it’d work out practically.\nConclusion  Mauricio: Apple — at best — have matched Android hardware […]\n From there, they sit and mock Apple and new new stuff they recently put out. They did say that Apple’s build quality is better (it is, actually), but the rest was simply mocking.\nThey left out all of the software-related topics (since a piece of hardware is completely worthless without matching software), and they focused exclusively on hardware specs instead of actual features (also known as \u0026ldquo;feature checklist dysfunction)\u0026rdquo;.\nAll-in-all, I find myself so frustrated by such ill-informed reporting, that I’m rather put-off at the moment.

        "source":"\nFor some time now, I’ve been a fan of the [App Judgment]({{% wayback \"http://revision3.com/appjudgment/\" %}}) podcast, which discusses new apps, devices and grades them on-air. Lately, however, I’ve noticed some saddeningly ill-informed “reporting” when it comes to Apple, iOS 6 and the new iPhone 5.\n\n## Bias is bias\n\nFirst of all, everybody is free to have their own opinions. If these guys prefer Android-based OSs and non-Apple hardware, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you’re in the business of reporting information, however, make sure you have your facts straight and aren’t misleading anybody by leaving out relevant information.\n\nAnything less than that is simply sloppy reporting.\n\n## “Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs”\n\nIn the recent episode entitled [Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs]({{% wayback \"http://revision3.com/appjudgment/iphone5-vs-galaxys3\" %}}), [Mauricio Balvanera]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/maubrowncow\" %}}) (producer) and [Jackie Talbott]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/jackietalbott\" %}}) (host) compare the new [Apple iPhone 5]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\" %}}) to the [Samsung Galaxy S III]({{% wayback \"http://www.samsung.com/global/galaxys3/\" %}}) in a number of factors. Here are some highlights:\n\n## Being pedantic\n\nFirst of all — and yes, I understand how completely pedantic I’m being — let’s break-down the accuracy of the title of the episode: “Apple vs. Android: iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3 Specs”.\n\n* *Apple* is a company, which makes both the phone hardware, as well as the phone software.\n\n* *Android* is a base operating system, which hardware vendors take, modify, and re-release as their own custom operating systems. Android is built primarily by Google.\n\n* *iPhone 5* and *Galaxy S III* are both (hardware) phones made by Apple and Samsung, respectively.\n    * Apple’s iPhone 5 runs *iOS*\n    * Samsung’s Galaxy S III runs Samsung’s modified version of the base Android OS. I have no idea what the product name of their custom OS is.\n\nThis is just plain sloppy.\n\n## Leapfrogged\n\n\u003e Mauricio: So we’re going to go over the technical differences between the two and basically decide whether or not Apple has leapfrogged Android technology.\n\nHas it already been decided that iOS has been leapfrogged by Android? If so, I wasn’t aware that this decision had been made. There are [several cases](/2011/09/05/skating-to-where-the-puck-will-be/) where Apple and iOS have left other devices and mobile platforms in the dust. Were these not taken into account when the decision was made that Android was ahead?\n\n## Device size\n\n\u003e Mauricio: So, the S III obviously takes the cake on size, while the iPhone beats out the S3 on thinness \\[…\\]\n\nYes, the S3 is physically larger. Does that mean it “wins”? I would argue not, but Mauricio seems to imply that requiring two hands is a *feature*. The be fair, however, he and Jackie both made it a point to mention that it can all boil down to a matter of preference, so there is neither a winner nor a loser here. Although I think they could have done a better job addressing this up-front, I’ll let this one slide.\n\nWhat they didn’t talk about, however, was the weight. The iPhone 5 *feels* considerably lighter than both the glass-backed 4 and 4S models, and clocks in at 3.95 ounces (112 grams). The Galaxy S III clocks in at just over 4.69 ounces (133 grams).\n\nNow, I own an iPhone 4 which clocks in at [4.8 ounces (137 grams)]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4/specs.html\" %}}). Various co-workers of mine have iPhone 4Ss, which clock in at [4.9 ounces (140 grams)]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4s/specs.html\" %}}). The new iPhone 5 is 28g lighter than the 4S, and 25g lighter than the 4, and the difference in your hand is _substantial_. It would be reasonable to infer that being 21g lighter than the Galaxy S III would be nearly equally substantial.\n\n## Camera\n\nThere was too much banter here for me to transcribe, but they basically compare 8 MP to 8 MP with 1080p recording for each, and leave it at that. What they completely leave out is the quality of the lense, the aperture, low-light boosting, etc., which really make or break the quality of the photographs.\n\nNow, I’m not going to pretend to be a photography buff who knows the difference from one aperture size to another, but what about providing real-world photographs comparing one device to another to see what the real-world differences are?\n\nAnd that’s only for still shots. What about the quality of the recorded video? 1080p is a shorthand reference for 1920-by–1080 *resolution*; this has nothing to do with *quality*. And what about things like image stabilization during recording? I know first-hand that the last couple of iPhones have had awesome image stabilization. How does the Galaxy S III stack up?\n\n## Lightning port\n\nFirst, Mauricio makes a comment about replacing the old proprietary dock for a new proprietary dock (*\\*womp, womp\\**) — implying that proprietary is inherently bad. Mauricio’s bias is showing.\n\nMauricio follows that up by explaining that the [Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) Forum]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Open_Mobile_Terminal_Platform\" %}}) chose to endorse Micro USB for power and data transport in 2007.

If the Lightning connector is supposed to last us another 10 years (as claimed by Apple), this seems to make the most sense.\n\n## Things that are missing\n\n\u003e No Micro SD \\[…\\]\n\nYay, because:\n\n* Micro SD is more than 10x *slower* than the built-in SSD drives, and…\n* Having multiple drives attached would complicate the UX of the device.\n\n\u003e No NFC (Boo!) \\[…\\]\n\n[Near-Field Communication (NFC)]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Near_field_communication\" %}}) is still (arguably) a solution in search of a problem. It’s a cart-before-the-horse situation. If NFC really does unlock some fantastic uses that make my life easier/better in some way, by all means, show them to me. I’d love to be proven wrong.\n\n[Phil Schiller explains]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20120912/interview-phil-schiller-on-why-the-iphone-5-has-a-new-connector-but-not-nfc-or-wireless-charging/\" %}}) the majority of use-cases that people want NFC to fit are addressed by Passbook.

(The A5X chip wasn’t compared.) What we won’t know until the tear-downs, however, is whether or not the A6 chip is quad-core, or how fast it is in absolute measurable units (i.e. gigahertz).

Let’s look at our options.\niPhone 5 or iPhone 6 “iPhone 5” is the name that people have most commonly assigned to the upcoming iPhone, but there are a number of problems with that guess. The first of which is that it’s not the fifth iPhone — it’s the sixth. We’ve had (in order):\n The original iPhone The iPhone 3G The iPhone 3GS The iPhone 4 And the iPhone 4S.  Because of this, I believe that we won’t be hearing about the “iPhone 5”. It also doesn’t make sense to jump from iPhone 4 and 4S straight to iPhone 6. Instead, I believe that when Tim Cook gets on stage next month, he’s going to call the device “the new iPhone”.\nBut for those of us who are geeks and care about the way that this model will be described over time, there are two obvious possibilities…\nThe New iPhone (5th generation) If you’ve watched Apple for any amount of time, you may have noticed that all Apple devices have a model identifier. For example, the new 15\u0026quot; Retina-enabled MacBook Pro has a model identifier of MacBookPro10,1. The third-generation iPad with Verizon LTE networking is iPad3,2, while the WiFi-only model is iPad3,1.\nLet’s look at the aforementioned list of iPhone models again, this time with their model identifiers.\n The original iPhone (iPhone1,1) The iPhone 3G (iPhone1,2) The iPhone 3GS (iPhone2,1) The iPhone 4 (iPhone3,1 for AT\u0026amp;T, iPhone3,2 for Verizon) And the iPhone 4S (iPhone4,1)  If we follow the pattern, the next iPhone will have a model identifier of iPhone5,1. This means that it will be the fifth-generation iPhone according to Apple’s own internal naming scheme.\nMost recently, Apple switched the iPad from versioned naming (i.e., iPad, iPad 2) to the take-off-your-coat-and-stay-awhile style of naming (i.e., “the new iPad”), and only refers to it by its generation when it needs to explicitly differentiate between models.\nApple’s iPod lineup has always followed this naming convention.

For example the iPhone 3G was not the third-generation iPhone — it was the iPhone with support for a third-generation wireless network.\nThe next iPhone is widely expected to have support for LTE wireless networking (i.e., real 4G), but it would be the fifth-generation iPhone. I can hear the confusing conversations amongst clueless teenagers now:\n “My iPhone has 5G, but yours is only 4G.”\n“Actually, mine is 3G and yours is 4G.”\n\u0026ldquo;No, mine is called ‘5G’, so it’s better than your 4G.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You mean my ‘4S’?\u0026rdquo;\n …and so on.

My previous home computer was a 17-inch MacBook Pro (early 2006, Core Duo 2.16). My previous work computer was a 13-inch MacBook (mid 2009, Core 2 Duo 2.13).  While the names are about as verbose as “HP Pavilion dv7t–7000 Quad Edition Entertainment Notebook PC”, or “Dell New Inspiron 17R Special Edition with Truelife”, they’re far more descriptive.\niPhones only come out with one model a year, where the only difference between devices of that model year is internal storage capacity. Following this pattern, the original was the iPhone (2007). I currently own an iPhone (2010) and am looking to replace it this fall with an iPhone (2012). They’re all iPhones. The model year only matters when you need to be more specific than that.\nOf course, if I wanted to be even more specific, I would say that I wanted to get a “white iPhone (2012; 128 GB; Verizon LTE)”.\nIf I were a betting man, this is where I would put my money.\nWhither the next iPhone? The next iPhone is expected to be announced in less than a month. The most recent rumors I’ve read suggest that the next iPhone will be announced on September 12, and begin shipping on September 21.\nThe Infamous They also suggest that it will have a redesigned body with a larger screen (if this is true, I’d bet on 1024x640 or 1536x960 (16:10) instead of the more awkward 16:9), a new 8/9-pin connector, fast LTE networking, a near-field communication (NFC) sensor, larger storage options, a faster quad-core Apple A6 CPU, and more memory (duh).\nIn a few weeks, we’ll find out what I’m going to be shelling-out $399 for. :)\n",
        "source":"\nMany people have questioned what the next iPhone — widely expected to be released in under a month’s time — will be called? Let’s look at our options.\n\n## iPhone 5 or iPhone 6\n\n“iPhone 5” is the name that people have most commonly assigned to the upcoming iPhone, but there are a number of problems with that guess. The first of which is that it’s not the fifth iPhone — it’s the sixth. We’ve had (in order):\n\n1. The original iPhone\n2. The iPhone 3G\n3. The iPhone 3GS\n4. The iPhone 4\n5. And the iPhone 4S.\n\nBecause of this, I believe that we won’t be hearing about the “iPhone 5”. It also doesn’t make sense to jump from iPhone 4 and 4S straight to *iPhone 6*. Instead, I believe that when Tim Cook gets on stage next month, he’s going to call the device “the new iPhone”.\n\nBut for those of us who are geeks and care about the way that this model will be described over time, there are two obvious possibilities…\n\n## The New iPhone (5th generation)\n\nIf you’ve watched Apple for any amount of time, you may have noticed that all Apple devices have a model identifier. For example, the new 15\" Retina-enabled MacBook Pro has a model identifier of `MacBookPro10,1`. The third-generation iPad with Verizon LTE networking is `iPad3,2`, while the WiFi-only model is `iPad3,1`.\n\nLet’s look at the aforementioned list of iPhone models again, this time with their model identifiers.\n\n* The original iPhone (`iPhone1,1`)\n* The iPhone 3G (`iPhone1,2`)\n* The iPhone 3GS (`iPhone2,1`)\n* The iPhone 4 (`iPhone3,1` for AT\u0026T, `iPhone3,2` for Verizon)\n* And the iPhone 4S (`iPhone4,1`)\n\nIf we follow the pattern, the next iPhone will have a model identifier of `iPhone5,1`. This means that it will be the *fifth-generation* iPhone according to Apple’s own internal naming scheme.\n\nMost recently, Apple switched the [iPad]({{% wayback \"http://apple.com/ipad/\" %}}) from versioned naming (i.e., iPad, iPad 2) to the *take-off-your-coat-and-stay-awhile* style of naming (i.e., “the new iPad”), and only refers to it by its *generation* when it needs to explicitly differentiate between models.\n\nApple’s [iPod]({{% wayback \"http://apple.com/ipod/\" %}}) lineup has always followed this naming convention. There was the original iPod with the mechanical scroll-wheel, followed by the iPod (2G) with the touch scroll-wheel. The first iPod I owned was a 15 GB iPod (3G). The first iPod to support photos was “iPod photo” (4G). The second iPod I owned was a glossy black 60 GB iPod (5G) *with video*. I currently own a 160 GB “iPod classic” (6G). Even the iPod touch has followed the same pattern. The current model is an iPod touch (4G).\n\nThe problem with the iPhone following this model is that there are different kinds of “Gs” floating around for phones that would only cause confusion. For example the iPhone 3G was not the third-generation iPhone — it was the iPhone with support for a third-generation wireless network.\n\nThe next iPhone is widely expected to have support for LTE wireless networking (i.e., *real* 4G), but it would be the fifth-generation iPhone. I can hear the confusing conversations amongst clueless teenagers now:\n\n\u003e “My iPhone has 5G, but yours is only 4G.”\n\u003e\n\u003e “Actually, mine is 3G and yours is 4G.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \"No, mine is called *‘5G’*, so it’s better than your 4G.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e \"You mean my *‘4S’?*\"\n\n…and so on. There is no way that Apple will begin throwing extra Gs around all willy-nilly like that.\n\n## The New iPhone (2012)\n\nBecause the Mac lineup has been around for so long, Apple doesn’t give their computers *names* like 3G, 3GS or 4. Just like with the new iPad, Apple simply refers to them at introductions as “the new iMac”, or “the new MacBook”.\n\nWhen it comes to tech support, however, they use specific identifiers to determine the model. For example:\n\n* My home computer is a [17-inch MacBook Pro (early 2011, Core i7 2.2)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\" %}}).\n* My work computer is a [13-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2012, Core i5 2.5)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.5-13-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html\" %}}).\n* My previous home computer was a [17-inch MacBook Pro (early 2006, Core Duo 2.16)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook_pro_2.16_17.html\" %}}).\n* My previous work computer was a [13-inch MacBook (mid 2009, Core 2 Duo 2.13)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.13-white-13-mid-2009-nvidia-specs.html\" %}}).\n\nWhile the names are about as verbose as “[HP Pavilion dv7t–7000 Quad Edition Entertainment Notebook PC]({{% wayback \"http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Laptops/HP-Pavilion/A3G47AV?HP-Pavilion-dv7t-7000-Quad-Edition-Entertainment-Notebook-PC\" %}})”, or “[Dell New Inspiron 17R Special Edition with Truelife]({{% wayback \"http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=dncwn25b\u0026model_id=inspiron-17r-se-7720\u0026c=us\u0026l=en\u0026s=dhs\u0026cs=19\" %}})”, they’re far more descriptive.\n\niPhones only come out with one model a year, where the only difference between devices of that *model year* is internal storage capacity. Following this pattern, the original was the iPhone (2007). I currently own an iPhone (2010) and am looking to replace it this fall with an iPhone (2012). They’re all *iPhones*. The model year only matters when you need to be more specific than that.\n\nOf course, if I wanted to be even more specific, I would say that I wanted to get a “white iPhone (2012; 128 GB; Verizon LTE)”.\n\nIf I were a betting man, this is where I would put my money.\n\n## Whither the next iPhone?\n\nThe next iPhone is expected to be announced in less than a month. The most recent rumors I’ve read suggest that the next iPhone will be [announced on September 12, and begin shipping on September 21]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/ipad_mini_even_througher\" %}}).\n\n*The Infamous They* also suggest that it will have a [redesigned body with a larger screen]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/12/new-2012-iphone-body-reportedly-leaks-shows-the-glass-front/\" %}}) (if this is true, I’d bet on 1024x640 or 1536x960 (`16:10`) instead of the more awkward `16:9`), a [new 8/9-pin connector]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3261613/new-iphone-usb-cable-mini-dock-connector-leak\" %}}), [fast LTE networking]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2012/03/14/verizon-exec-slips-suggests-4g-lte-equipped-iphone-to-launch-this-year/\" %}}), a [near-field communication (NFC) sensor]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57459639-37/iphone-5-prototypes-reportedly-reveal-nfc-support/\" %}}), [larger storage options]({{% wayback \"https://www.gottabemobile.com/will-the-iphone-5-be-the-first-128gb-iphone/\" %}}), a faster [quad-core Apple A6 CPU]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57467136-233/rumor-apple-to-include-quad-core-a6-in-next-iphone/\" %}}), and more memory (*duh*).\n\nIn a few weeks, we’ll find out what I’m going to be shelling-out $399 for. :)\n"},

        "plain":"Do I look like a cow? It’s the hair, isn’t it? I need a haircut — all in this week’s issue of Clueless Recruiters. (Cue theme music!) Explanation There are few things that technical people are more annoyed by than technical recruiters. A very large segment of the technical recruiting industry has made a bad name for the rest of their industry by relentlessly spamming technical professionals after having not done their homework.\nThese people hock job openings the same way that sleazy salesmen hock used cars. These recruiting companies need to radically change how they do business with the technical crowd, and the Clueless Recruiters series is an attempt to call out clueless technical recruiters who contact me for jobs that are clearly a terrible fit. Everything here is posted from real exchanges between myself and recruiters, entirely uncut. Enjoy!\n Recruiter Schlock Here’s one I got this morning from a clueless recruiter. For reference, here is my résumé.\n Hope all is well. I wanted to reach out to you in regards to an opportunity I’m working on with [company] located in San Jose.\n Hello [name], I am doing well. It’s good to put a face to a name (http://[domain-name].com/about/team). I’m curious, however as to why you’re emailing me about a position in California since I haven’t lived in that state for a few years.\n A company led by a team of experienced executives, designers, and engineers from TiVo, Netflix, Vudu, Disney, MTV, MGM, Apple, Best Buy, E!, eBay, Yahoo!, and WebTV. I’m working with [name], VP of Engineering and he is looking for a solid Ruby Developer. The company is backed by blue-chip venture capital firms including NEA, Redpoint Ventures, Greycroft Partners, BV Capital, LA angel investor [name], and independent investors from the entertainment and technology industries. Please let me know if this is something you would be interested in. I have included the job req below.\n When you leave Silicon Valley behind, you realize that people find the strangest things enticing about positions. Personally, I’m not even remotely interested in “status” as much as whether or not the work I’m doing will have a positive impact on the world.\n [Description of company and their product.]\n I know. I’ve played with it. It’s… meh. It tries to be too many things without actually being good at any one of them.\n About the Position\nWe’re looking for a strong autonomous general programmer with great Ruby knowledge and with capacity and will to evolve. We’re currently using a custom Ruby stack with Rails components and a MongoDB backend, but are looking for someone with enough experience to adapt to new technologies as needed.\n Well, this clearly doesn’t sound like me. You Googled my name before contacting me, right?

Explanation There are few things that technical people are more annoyed by than technical recruiters. A very large segment of the technical recruiting industry has made a bad name for the rest of their industry by relentlessly spamming technical professionals after having not done their homework.\nThese people hock job openings the same way that sleazy salesmen hock used cars. These recruiting companies need to radically change how they do business with the technical crowd, and the Clueless Recruiters series is an attempt to call out clueless technical recruiters who contact me for jobs that are clearly a terrible fit. Everything here is posted from real exchanges between myself and recruiters, entirely uncut. Enjoy!\n Recruiter Schlock Here’s one I got yesterday from a clueless recruiter.

I knew that wasn’t going to happen delivering pizzas, so I went back to school to get my Bachelor’s, found a better paying job with a great group of people.

Well, not \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e, but I’ve always found that it’s easier to talk to a female as a friend than it is to talk to a female that I’m interested in. Without even meaning to, I find myself trying to come up with interesting things to say, and they always come out as inane banter. It’s when there’s no pressure and I’m comfortable being myself that I can chat up the ladies with no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of months after your mom left, I was out by myself exploring a new spot along Lake Washington I’d never seen before. It was nice, and the weather was great, and after a while of hanging out, I decided to go find something to eat. I was wandering around this few-block section of town where there were a lot of restaurants and ended up at this little Thai restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walked inside, I noticed only a single patron in the entire restaurant — a tall blonde with blue eyes and a beautiful smile. I was somewhat intimidated because she was beautiful and I was immediately attracted to her. I found another table across the restaurant, sat down, and ordered my food. The restaurant was small and we could see each other across the way. We kept making (then breaking) eye contact while we were each waiting for our meals. I thought to myself “there’s no way I can talk to her.

Was that really a big deal? No. So I got up, walked over to her table and asked if she minded if I joined her. She said no, so I sat down, introduced myself, and asked her how she ended up at a restaurant that was so empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there we ate and chatted for about 45 minutes.

The little voice in my head had switched from “I can’t” to “I can!”. All I had to do was take a chance, and I was able to prove myself wrong. From there, it made it much easier to strike up conversations with people I didn’t know.

        "plain":"Growing up, I always heard the adage “you can do anything you put your mind to”. I never really understood it because I think I took it too literally.\nThis post is part of a larger series written to my children entitled “Life Lessons”. Read the Introduction to learn more, or view all of the \u0026ldquo;Life Lessons\u0026rdquo; posts.\nI thought to myself, “you couldn’t move a mountain if you put your mind to it, so whoever said that must be full of crap.” It wasn’t until I took a step back from the literal and started to look at the intended meaning that it finally began to make sense to me.\nPutting my mind to it I figured the first part out in my early twenties. I put my mind into doing the best job in college that I possibly could, and I graduated at the top of my (admittedly very small) class. I was determined to drive my career from the bottom to the top.\nMy first post-college job gave my a pay bump of $15,000 a year. My next jump was by almost $30,000. My next jump was by another $35,000. By working hard, studying my craft, striving for excellence, and continuing to aim for the top, my annual salary jumped by $80,000 in just 4 short years.\nSmarts vs. Hustle It would be misguided to say that it’s only about smarts. There are a number of people whom I’ve encountered over the years who are all incredibly smart. Some of them were doing as well as I was, some better, but many were doing worse. Why? Because they lacked hustle. By being smart, they’d gotten lazy in school and never really learned how to apply themselves.\nWhen I was a kid, I was the same way.
