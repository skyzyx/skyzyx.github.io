[C|Net]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57459639-37/iphone-5-prototypes-reportedly-reveal-nfc-support/\" %}}) discusses more about this rumor.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/google-wallet.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Larger storage options\n\n**False.** It *still* tops out at 64 GB. I was really hoping for a 128 GB model. [Gotta Be Mobile]({{% wayback \"https://www.gottabemobile.com/will-the-iphone-5-be-the-first-128gb-iphone/\" %}}) discusses more about this rumor.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/No-Storage-iPhone.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## Faster quad-core Apple A6 CPU\n\n**Maybe True:** Yes, the iPhone 5 includes the Apple A6 CPU that is “up to twice as fast” as the A5 chip. (The A5X chip wasn’t compared.) What we won’t know until the tear-downs, however, is whether or not the A6 chip is quad-core, or how fast it is in absolute measurable units (i.e. gigahertz). [C|Net]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57467136-233/rumor-apple-to-include-quad-core-a6-in-next-iphone/\" %}}) discusses more about this rumor.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/iPhone5_0254.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\n\n## More memory\n\n**Unknown.** We’ll need to wait for the tear-downs for this.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis appears to be a really solid update. Beyond these features, there were [several other features]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3321568/apples-iphone-5-event-heres-everything-that-happened\" %}}) that were added. I’m only a couple of months away from the end of my contract with AT\u0026T, and I’ll be dropping some coin on the new iPhone 5.\n"},
