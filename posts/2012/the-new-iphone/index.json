There was the original iPod with the mechanical scroll-wheel, followed by the iPod (2G) with the touch scroll-wheel. The first iPod I owned was a 15 GB iPod (3G). The first iPod to support photos was “iPod photo” (4G). The second iPod I owned was a glossy black 60 GB iPod (5G) \u003cem\u003ewith video\u003c/em\u003e.

For example, the new 15\" Retina-enabled MacBook Pro has a model identifier of `MacBookPro10,1`. The third-generation iPad with Verizon LTE networking is `iPad3,2`, while the WiFi-only model is `iPad3,1`.\n\nLet’s look at the aforementioned list of iPhone models again, this time with their model identifiers.\n\n* The original iPhone (`iPhone1,1`)\n* The iPhone 3G (`iPhone1,2`)\n* The iPhone 3GS (`iPhone2,1`)\n* The iPhone 4 (`iPhone3,1` for AT\u0026T, `iPhone3,2` for Verizon)\n* And the iPhone 4S (`iPhone4,1`)\n\nIf we follow the pattern, the next iPhone will have a model identifier of `iPhone5,1`. This means that it will be the *fifth-generation* iPhone according to Apple’s own internal naming scheme.\n\nMost recently, Apple switched the [iPad]({{% wayback \"http://apple.com/ipad/\" %}}) from versioned naming (i.e., iPad, iPad 2) to the *take-off-your-coat-and-stay-awhile* style of naming (i.e., “the new iPad”), and only refers to it by its *generation* when it needs to explicitly differentiate between models.\n\nApple’s [iPod]({{% wayback \"http://apple.com/ipod/\" %}}) lineup has always followed this naming convention. There was the original iPod with the mechanical scroll-wheel, followed by the iPod (2G) with the touch scroll-wheel. The first iPod I owned was a 15 GB iPod (3G). The first iPod to support photos was “iPod photo” (4G). The second iPod I owned was a glossy black 60 GB iPod (5G) *with video*. I currently own a 160 GB “iPod classic” (6G). Even the iPod touch has followed the same pattern. The current model is an iPod touch (4G).\n\nThe problem with the iPhone following this model is that there are different kinds of “Gs” floating around for phones that would only cause confusion. For example the iPhone 3G was not the third-generation iPhone — it was the iPhone with support for a third-generation wireless network.\n\nThe next iPhone is widely expected to have support for LTE wireless networking (i.e., *real* 4G), but it would be the fifth-generation iPhone. I can hear the confusing conversations amongst clueless teenagers now:\n\n\u003e “My iPhone has 5G, but yours is only 4G.”\n\u003e\n\u003e “Actually, mine is 3G and yours is 4G.”\n\u003e\n\u003e \"No, mine is called *‘5G’*, so it’s better than your 4G.\"\n\u003e\n\u003e \"You mean my *‘4S’?*\"\n\n…and so on. There is no way that Apple will begin throwing extra Gs around all willy-nilly like that.\n\n## The New iPhone (2012)\n\nBecause the Mac lineup has been around for so long, Apple doesn’t give their computers *names* like 3G, 3GS or 4. Just like with the new iPad, Apple simply refers to them at introductions as “the new iMac”, or “the new MacBook”.\n\nWhen it comes to tech support, however, they use specific identifiers to determine the model. For example:\n\n* My home computer is a [17-inch MacBook Pro (early 2011, Core i7 2.2)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.2-17-early-2011-unibody-thunderbolt-specs.html\" %}}).\n* My work computer is a [13-inch MacBook Pro (mid 2012, Core i5 2.5)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.5-13-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html\" %}}).\n* My previous home computer was a [17-inch MacBook Pro (early 2006, Core Duo 2.16)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook_pro_2.16_17.html\" %}}).\n* My previous work computer was a [13-inch MacBook (mid 2009, Core 2 Duo 2.13)]({{% wayback \"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.13-white-13-mid-2009-nvidia-specs.html\" %}}).\n\nWhile the names are about as verbose as “[HP Pavilion dv7t–7000 Quad Edition Entertainment Notebook PC]({{% wayback \"http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Laptops/HP-Pavilion/A3G47AV?HP-Pavilion-dv7t-7000-Quad-Edition-Entertainment-Notebook-PC\" %}})”, or “[Dell New Inspiron 17R Special Edition with Truelife]({{% wayback \"http://configure.us.dell.com/dellstore/config.aspx?oc=dncwn25b\u0026model_id=inspiron-17r-se-7720\u0026c=us\u0026l=en\u0026s=dhs\u0026cs=19\" %}})”, they’re far more descriptive.\n\niPhones only come out with one model a year, where the only difference between devices of that *model year* is internal storage capacity. Following this pattern, the original was the iPhone (2007). I currently own an iPhone (2010) and am looking to replace it this fall with an iPhone (2012). They’re all *iPhones*. The model year only matters when you need to be more specific than that.\n\nOf course, if I wanted to be even more specific, I would say that I wanted to get a “white iPhone (2012; 128 GB; Verizon LTE)”.\n\nIf I were a betting man, this is where I would put my money.\n\n## Whither the next iPhone?\n\nThe next iPhone is expected to be announced in less than a month. The most recent rumors I’ve read suggest that the next iPhone will be [announced on September 12, and begin shipping on September 21]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2012/08/ipad_mini_even_througher\" %}}).\n\n*The Infamous They* also suggest that it will have a [redesigned body with a larger screen]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/12/new-2012-iphone-body-reportedly-leaks-shows-the-glass-front/\" %}}) (if this is true, I’d bet on 1024x640 or 1536x960 (`16:10`) instead of the more awkward `16:9`), a [new 8/9-pin connector]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/22/3261613/new-iphone-usb-cable-mini-dock-connector-leak\" %}}), [fast LTE networking]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2012/03/14/verizon-exec-slips-suggests-4g-lte-equipped-iphone-to-launch-this-year/\" %}}), a [near-field communication (NFC) sensor]({{% wayback \"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57459639-37/iphone-5-prototypes-reportedly-reveal-nfc-support/\" %}}), [larger storage options]({{% wayback \"https://www.gottabemobile.com/will-the-iphone-5-be-the-first-128gb-iphone/\" %}}), a faster [quad-core Apple A6 CPU]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57467136-233/rumor-apple-to-include-quad-core-a6-in-next-iphone/\" %}}), and more memory (*duh*).\n\nIn a few weeks, we’ll find out what I’m going to be shelling-out $399 for. :)\n"},
