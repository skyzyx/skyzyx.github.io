You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"f5IcBtaMR_k\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube. It was alright — if a bit gimmicky — but all was well in those days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wtf-wii\"\u003eWTF Wii?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that you sold a bajillion of them, and that was the beginning of your problems. You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/super-mario-galaxy.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMetroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuper Smash Bros.

Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"wii-u\"\u003eWii U\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003camp-youtube data-videoid=\"4e3qaPg_keg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"704\" height=\"396\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv fallback\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThe video could not be loaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/amp-youtube\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whats-next-with-the-nx\"\u003eWhat’s next with the NX?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/nx.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"nintendo-account\"\u003eNintendo Account\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, figure out how to run a \u003cem\u003efreaking\u003c/em\u003e Nintendo account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of us live international lives.

I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/retro-fighters.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGive us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware.

It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sure that \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905133840/http://supermario3dworld.nintendo.com\"\u003eSuper Mario 3D World\u003c/a\u003e doesn’t require as much processing power as \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160905133840/https://www.callofduty.com/advancedwarfare\"\u003eCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u003c/a\u003e, so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant.

Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK). They have way more users than Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony combined. They have powerful developer frameworks that enable game developers to build bigger, better, faster worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new Apple TV is squarely in your turf.

You had an amazing controller, fun games, and the console itself was a gorgeous little cube. Consumers didn’t expect high-definition or broadband connectivity in those days, and what we ended up with were hours of fun with Luigi’s Mansion, NFL Blitz, and more hours spent on Metroid Prime (and Prime 2) than I can even begin to count.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  It also had that adapter where you could play your DS games on your GameCube. It was alright — if a bit gimmicky — but all was well in those days.\nWTF Wii? I know that you sold a bajillion of them, and that was the beginning of your problems. You targeted “casual gamers” and families. These are the people who still have computers that are more than 5 years old. These are people who will buy late in the cycle, then hang onto their ancient technology for years to come.\nYou also had those motion controls. I swear that I tried my best to like them, but they just never felt natural to me. I never made it very far in Metroid Prime 3, and I never got around to finishing Super Mario Galaxy (despite how amazing the game was) simply because I couldn’t use those unwieldy controls for all that long at a time.\n  You also made a few massive mistakes that put you in last place in my heart against the PS3 and Xbox 360. Firstly, you went for 480p when everybody else went for 1080p. It was time for HD, and you missed the (very obvious) boat. Blu-ray and HD-DVD were duking it out, Sony put a Blu-ray player in the PS3, and while Xbox initially supported HD-DVD, they at least shipped a high-definition console.\nSecondly, you didn’t have your house in order when it comes to a centralized Nintendo Account. I had a Wii die, and ended up losing all of my digital purchases. Also, playing with friends was awful because (a) it was some long UUID-like value, and (b) it was tied to a console (instead of a user).\nLastly was content. Because the Wii was so woefully underpowered compared to the competition, the Wii ended up with the lion’s share of shovelware. Terrible, terrible games that were just terrible. The only good games for that console were:\n Super Mario Galaxy (Parts 1 and 2) Mario Kart Wii (Sort of. This was the weakest of the Mario Karts.) Metroid Prime 3 (So I heard. Because I couldn’t finish it.) Super Smash Bros. Brawl Super Paper Mario New Super Mario Bros. …and Donkey Kong Returns was pretty good.  8 good games on that console and everything else was crap. Even the games that could have been good were not, because they looked and worked much better on the competing consoles.\nWii U Wii University? Wii U-2? I have no idea who thought that this was a good name for the console. I bought a 32 GB Wii U at Christmas 2012, and what happened? Firstly, it took so long to download and install the day-one patches that by the time the console was ready to go, the GamePad was dead. After that, it mostly sat dormant in my bedroom for 2 years. The store was nearly empty for most of that time, except for a few indie games which weren’t that interesting.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  Also, what’s up with the GamePad? For all intents and purposes, it is a complete disaster. Firstly, it’s huge, and doesn’t feel as good and tight as a normal controller. Secondly, it gets 2-3 hours of battery life before it needs a complete recharge. And lastly, for the very few games that actually use it as a second screen (instead of simply mirroring the TV screen), it’s usability is limited because I have to move my eyes away from the TV to look at my hands and hope that I don’t get killed by an enemy in the meantime.\nInitially, the console was so mind-numbingly slow, that I would fall asleep while waiting for the console to respond if I tried to play after the kids went to bed. It has definitely gotten better over the last 3.5 years, but over half of this console’s life was plagued with SO. MANY. ISSUES. And now that I hear you’re about to replace the console after 4–4.5 years on the market (where the first 2 years were essentially a bust), I kinda feel like I should have skipped this generation all-together and saved my money and attention. I kinda feel like I was cheated.\nThe Wii U was exactly the console that the original Wii should have been in the first place. It had the specs of a last-gen console, and only a few first-party games were made fresh for this console (I’m explicitly not counting Zelda: Wind Waker and Zelda: Twilight Princess because I already own them — and love them — for the GameCube).\nWhat’s next with the NX?   Nintendo Account Still, you haven’t figured out a few things — and if you don’t figure them out before the NX, then I expect the NX will bomb too.\nFirst, figure out how to run a freaking Nintendo account.\n  I should be able to sign-in the same way on the Internet as I do on the console.\n  I should be able to log into my Nintendo account from more than one TV console, and more than one handheld console (I have 2 3DS’, but only one is allowed to be connected to my account).\n  Some of us live international lives. Allow me to log onto my child’s Canadian console using my U.S. account, so that I can continue using my game data (etc.) while spending time with my children in another country.\n  There should not be separate balances for the Wii U store vs. the 3DS store. This is ridiculous. They should be the same store, the same account, the same money. I login, buy stuff, and play.\n  Lastly, I should be able to throw my console in the ocean, buy a new one, log-in, and be able to re-download all of my games and settings.\n  Microsoft has this figured out. Apple has this figured out. Sony has this (sorta) figured out. Why haven’t you been able to figure this out yet?\nNormal Controllers Please, for the love of god, stop making controllers “unique”. I’m sick and tired of unique. I’ve been dealing with Nintendo’s uniqueness for 10 years now, and it’s time to stop. Give me a normal controller — like you used to do. Xbox and Playstation have been shipping modified versions of the SNES controller since 2001 and 1995, respectively. You nailed the controller 25 years ago — go back to it. Hold the Xbox One and PS4 controllers in your hands and feel how good they are? The Nintendo Pro controller is far better than the GamePad, but it’s terrible compared to the other major players.\n  Give us normal controllers, based on the SNES (or GameCube — my favorite) controller, and stop trying to do things that are unique to your hardware. Save that for games and gameplay, not hardware.\nFigure out the first vs. third-party game situation Nintendo hardware has been running a generation behind ever since the Wii was released in 2006. It’s pretty well-known that the Wii was just a modified GameCube in terms of hardware (which was why it had backward-compatibility). But in doing so, you’ve fallen a generation behind. You continued this with the Wii U, which was released in 2012 with the specs of a 2006-era console.\nI’m sure that Super Mario 3D World doesn’t require as much processing power as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, so it may make sense to ship a lower-power console if you want to focus on first-party games on your first-party console. This is a pretty giant shift away from the golden ages where all of the good games from all of the good developers were on a Nintendo console.\nYou’ve mostly ceded that to Microsoft and Sony, who do a fantastic job with third-party game developers. Nowadays, the only good games for Nintendo consoles are first-party Nintendo games. Anything else has mostly been garbage (speaking mostly about the Wii and Wii U generations).\nNow, if you want to focus on first-party games, that’s brilliant. You make the best games for your own console. But — there are a few things to think about, because you’ve been sending mixed signals for a long time now.\n  If you want to focus on making first-party games on Nintendo consoles, that’s great. But you need to actually focus on making first-party games. You didn’t do this for the first half of the Wii U’s existence.\n  If you don’t want to put much effort into third-party games, that’s cool too — but say so. Stop allowing so much crapware to be sold for Nintendo consoles. But also remember that if the best third-party games are on a Sony or Microsoft console, and customers have a limited budget, who’s console are they going to buy?\n  If you want to enable and support third-party developers, great! Then do it! Provide them support, help them to deliver the best possible gaming experiences, and ship hardware that is as powerful as the next-generation Sony and Microsoft consoles.\n  Embrace Digital Downloads Digital downloads are the now, not just the future. Build out a world-class online store that can be accessed from TV consoles, handheld consoles, and computer Internet users alike. Focus on making downloads both fast and plentiful. Ship fewer and fewer games on disc, and instead ship larger hard drives that support expansion through external disks.\nEmbrace broadband, hard drives, digital downloads, and a world-class online store. You implemented the kids’ version of those things in the Wii U. Now build a modern version for grown-ups.\nPay Attention to your Competition Aside from Nintendo, Apple is the only other company with small-screen (e.g., iOS) and large screen (e.g., macOS, tvOS) gaming platforms. Apple nailed the Apple account details long ago (starting with iTunes and the iPod). They have a rock-solid gaming platform for third-parties (powerful mobile hardware, and a brilliant SDK). They have way more users than Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony combined. They have powerful developer frameworks that enable game developers to build bigger, better, faster worlds.\nThe new Apple TV is squarely in your turf. No, they may not have their own Marios or Zeldas or Samuses, but their platform has enabled the likes of Lili, Oceanhorn, and The Legend of Skyfish. They may not (yet) have the rich history of Nintendo’s characters, but it’s only a matter of time.\nThe video could not be loaded.\n  Right now, Apple is focused on TV. And that’s probably good for you. But what happens when they ship an Apple TV “Pro” focused on gaming? They have an excellent SDK, an excellent games platform, the MFi Controller program, rock-solid account management, extremely fast game (i.e., “app”) downloads, and a dearth of end-users with limited funds for new game consoles?\nSee the follow-up, “Dear Nintendo, Part II”\n ",

But a gun in the hands of a dangerous person is capable of taking a substantially higher number of lives at once than nearly any other weapon humankind has ever devised[^1]. We do not show enough respect for this dangerous capability as we should as a society.\n\n[^1]: Bombs are capable of killing even _more_ people than guns. But guns are also much easier to access legally.\n\nWhat if we could reduce gun-related deaths by 20%… 30%… 40%? Would that be worth it? Are the lives of those people are worth it? Are the lives of the kids at Sandy Hook Elementary worth it? Are the lives of the reporter and cameraman who were gunned-down on-air worth it? Are the lives of the kids who get a hold of their parents’ gun and accidentally kill themselves, their parent, or their siblings worth it?\n\nGuns are far too easy to purchase through legal channels because of well-known loopholes in the system. By closing the legal loopholes, law enforcement can spend more time focusing on covering illegal gun sales.\n\n## Justifying an outrageous failure\n\nFrance, Germany, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Australia, Spain, and even the Czech Republic are ahead of us on this issue. For a country which claims to be _the best country in the entire world_, how can we continue to justify such an outrageous failure of our society?\n\nGun control does **not** mean _taking away your guns_. It doesn’t mean a _disarmament_ of you and your family (unless your family is crazy, of course). It refers to the _enforcement of the responsibility_ of owning a gun. You’re responsible, right?\n\nThe founding fathers granted us the right to form and maintain a militia… using **muskets**. They did not know that one day the weapons industry would rake-in _billions of dollars per year_. They did not know that our society would shift from being primarily rural to being primarily urban/industrial. It does not mean that you are **guaranteed** the right to own _assault weapons_.\n\n## How much longer?\n\nHow long are we going to stand by and do nothing (except pray) while angry/crazy people shoot-up large groups of people? How long are we going to update our Facebook profile photos with the French flag, or hear about **yet another** mass-shooting (San Bernadino, Orlando, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Columbine, etc.), and choose to do **absolutely nothing at all** about lifting a finger to make things better?\n\nBecause guns. Or politics. Or religion that has been tainted by politics. They have propagandized the heck out of the second amendment, and the gun industry is — ahem — making a “killing” in revenue.\n\nI have concerns about unfettered gun ownership. I’m sure that you also have your own concerns about the gun ownership issue. But we certainly recognize that a problem exists, right? That mass-shooting after mass-shooting is not _normal_, right? We don’t live in central Africa, or Colombia, or Mexico City, right?\n\nWe need to work together to come up with something better than what we have today. Maybe you don’t like the phrase “gun control”. Fine. But you agree that we shouldn’t hand-out handguns to crazy people like candy, right? You agree that having a waiting period is a good thing, right? And that a standardized psychological evaluation _could_ be a good thing, right?\n\nSo let’s start there and **work together** to come up with something **better** than we have today. THAT is the definition of “gun control” — the rules by which people can buy, sell, and own guns (which, may I remind you, are _some_ of the most dangerous weapons that humankind has ever invented).\n\nYou wouldn’t hand a toddler a hunting knife, would you?\n\n## Update ({{\u003cdate \"2018-08-05\"\u003e}})\n\nMaybe I was wrong. Maybe we Americans have gone so far off the rails that we've become irredeemable.\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"who-is-america\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/QkXeMoBPSDk\"\n       sourceTitle=\"Who Is America?

That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd follows that up with an important premise:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lastly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmericans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government.

The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"making-a-better-america\"\u003eMaking A Better America\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/red-state-titanic.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003ePhoto by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen \u003cem\u003edramatically\u003c/em\u003e since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class.

But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don\u0026rsquo;t like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they\u0026rsquo;re not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing.

What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you \u003cstrong\u003emust\u003c/strong\u003e vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate.

        "plain":"In response to “I moved to the US 7 years ago from Finland — here's what Americans don't understand about Nordic countries”, and why I support Bernie Sanders. This was originally posted to Facebook Notes.\n Here\u0026rsquo;s what Americans don\u0026rsquo;t understand about Nordic countries Anu Partanen, writing for The Atlantic:\n Commentators repeat endlessly the mantra that Bernie Sanders ’ Nordic-style policies might sound nice, but they\u0026rsquo;d never work in the U.S. The upshot is that Sanders, and his supporters, are being treated a bit like children—good-hearted, but hopelessly naive. That\u0026rsquo;s probably how Nordic people seem to many Americans, too.\nA Nordic person myself, I left my native Finland seven years ago and moved to the U.S. Although I\u0026rsquo;m now a U.S. citizen, I hear these kinds of comments from Americans all the time—at cocktail parties and at panel discussions, in town hall meetings and on the opinion pages. Nordic countries are the way they are, I\u0026rsquo;m told, because they are small, homogeneous \u0026ldquo;nanny states\u0026rdquo; where everyone looks alike, thinks alike, and belongs to a big extended family.\nThis, in turn, makes Nordic citizens willing to sacrifice their own interests to help their neighbors. Americans don\u0026rsquo;t feel a similar kinship with other Americans, I\u0026rsquo;m told, and thus will never sacrifice their own interests for the common good.\n And follows that up with an important premise:\n But this vision of homogeneous, altruistic Nordic lands is mostly a fantasy. The choices Nordic countries have made have little to do with altruism or kinship. Rather, Nordic people have made their decisions out of self-interest. Nordic nations offer their citizens—all of their citizens, but especially the middle class—high-quality services that save people a lot of money, time, and trouble. This is what Americans fail to understand: My taxes in Finland were used to pay for top-notch services for me.\n And lastly,\n Americans are not wrong to abhor the specters of socialism and big government. In fact, as a proud Finn, I often like to remind my American friends that my countrymen in Finland fought two brutal wars against the Soviet Union to preserve Finland\u0026rsquo;s freedom and independence against socialism. No one wants to live in a society that doesn\u0026rsquo;t support individual liberty, entrepreneurship, and open markets.\nBut the truth is that free-market capitalism and universal social policies go well together — this isn\u0026rsquo;t about big government, it\u0026rsquo;s about smart government.\n This is a very good piece, and I hope you can take a few minutes to read it all. In the U.S., and especially among the Boomer generation, they hear \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and tend to equate it with Russian communism (which was actually never communism, but rather a dictator-style totalitarian socialism).\nToo Much Capitalism Is Bad For You  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/5065175199/in/album-72157652056682098/\n For me, I see the pros and cons of such a capitalistic-driven society. The pros are a tremendous number of advancements, and the opportunity for tremendous wealth for the very-very-few (i.e., the top 1%). But the biggest cons to capitalism (that we\u0026rsquo;re seeing now) is cronyism and corporate welfare — the fact that an oligarchy of corporations has more influence on our Congress than our citizen voters do. IMO, there is a tipping point where, by embracing too much capitalism, we give more power to the rich… which only serves to eliminate the middle-class (which we\u0026rsquo;ve been seeing for a while now).\nSome people (i.e., my mother) hear the word \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; and begin describing (extremist) Marxist communism. Not the same thing! America is currently ≈30% democratic socialist (e.g., medicare, social security, police \u0026amp; fire departments, running water and electricity, bank regulations) and ≈70% capitalist (e.g., mass-market electronics manufactured in China, Wall St. influence in elections, congresspeople leaving their jobs and taking a 1425% salary increase by becoming corporate lobbyists).\nThe good ideas that I see in Canada and Scandinavian countries is precisely what this op-ed discusses. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that the government could or should take over every need for every person. What I think instead is that the government\u0026rsquo;s role is to provide a solid foundation for all (e.g., education, healthcare, police \u0026amp; fire departments, Internet service free from corporate influence and control), which allows individual American citizens a more evenly-balanced opportunity to engage capitalism and new ideas, start companies, and let the free markets decide how successful those opportunities are.\nMaking A Better America  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/16578930073/in/album-72157652056682098/\n I want to leave a better world behind for my kids. A world where my daughter is paid as much as my son. A world where if my son has a cool idea, that he can invest his energy in research and development to build it, without spending the next 10–20 years after college paying off crippling amounts of debt. A world where my daughter can go out to a nightclub with friends after work and not be called a \u0026ldquo;bitch\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;whore\u0026rdquo; just because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have a conversation with some guy who starts talking to her.\nBecause of the corporate welfare and cronyistic ways that corporations and congress have benefitted from each other over the years, I do share the skepticism that many on the right have with the government actually doing a good job with the money that we give them for programs. Look at education, for example. Education in K-12 has been pretty bad for a long time, and does not equip people for the world after high school. Fewer people are attending college, so in order for a college to be more effective, it needs to charge more, which excludes more people for cost reasons, which causes it to charge more. The cost of college has risen dramatically since the last generation attended. The result: more people who don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how our country works. More blue-collar workers with jobs that are being shipped overseas, triggering outrage and further destruction of the middle-class. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle.\nWhat I’m currently hearing from Ted Cruz , Donald Trump , and Rand Paul is idealistic rhetoric (e.g., “make America great again!”) without any kind of plan for how. We’re going to do these great things (!), but have no plan for how to accomplish them. What I’m hearing from Hillary and Bernie are plans for how to actually accomplish the things that they support. As an independent voter who is interested in looking at the facts instead of self-serving rhetoric, right now, the left is making more sense to me than the right. But I would love to see someone on the right with a plan for making America great again and including all Americans in that plan.\nUnfair?  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/22122675480/in/album-72157652056682098/\n Yes, a 60 year old couple with no kids paying more money in taxes so that some other couple can have their kids in better daycare sounds unfair at first. But what if I told you that by not paying a very small percentage toward those kids, their parents had to struggle a lot more to make ends meet. Financial trouble leads to frustration and drinking, and ultimately destroys their marriage. The kids grow up with frustrated parents who don\u0026rsquo;t like each other, spend time getting into trouble, and since the parents are overworked, they\u0026rsquo;re not able to put money away for college. The kids grow up and turn to crime to make ends meet. Theft, robbery, drugs. And they do it all in the same neighborhood as the older couple who didn\u0026rsquo;t want to invest in anybody other than themselves. The old couple complains about how this country is going to hell, and are constantly frustrated by the crime and drug-use in their community.\nMaking small investments into your community and neighbors is not a bad thing. By raising-up the foundation for everyone, everybody benefits, albeit indirectly.\nSupport the Radical Center  Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/4764160036/in/album-72157652056682098/\n Lastly, I think our current 2-party system is the most toxic aspect of American politics. What makes is even worse are the people who continue to reinforce the idea that you must vote for the primary Republican or the primary Democratic candidate. The Republican party has already assumed that Clinton will win the nomination on the Democratic side, but the race between herself and Sanders is extremely close. Conversely, the fact that loose cannons like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have made it as far as they have over more sane and level-headed candidates like Rand Paul and Marco Rubio is saddening.\nThe only way to break free of the 2-party system is to stop reinforcing this 2-party mentality. IMO, it’s toxic to the American people that the RNC and the DNC are private corporations who pay for broadcast airtime, and can change the rules to determine who can/cannot be part of the debates. This leads to Tweedism, and further separates the voters from the nomination process (in addition to super-delegates and the electoral college).\n Source: Lessig at MIT: \u0026#34;Tweedism\u0026#34;\nI would also love to see the entire population of the United States abstain from the next election until we could vote on meaningful campaign finance reform, but that will never happen.\nReform Ultimately, however, none of the promises made by presidential candidates will come to pass without substantial campaign finance reform.

With Ted Cruz taking money from the Oil \u0026amp; Coal industries, with Hillary Clinton taking money from Wall Street, and with Donald Trump taking money from the KKK, we’re all in big trouble.\nCitizen-funded elections is the only way to achieve this.\nP.S.

Conversely, the fact that loose cannons like {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}} and {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}} have made it as far as they have over more sane and level-headed candidates like {{\u003c person name=\"Rand Paul\" \u003e}} and {{\u003c person name=\"Marco Rubio\" \u003e}} is saddening.\n\nThe only way to break free of the 2-party system is to stop reinforcing this 2-party mentality. IMO, it’s toxic to the American people that the RNC and the DNC are private corporations who pay for broadcast airtime, and can change the rules to determine who can/cannot be part of the debates. This leads to _Tweedism_, and further separates the voters from the nomination process (in addition to _super-delegates_ and the _electoral college_).\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"tweedism\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/pFZEV7TeZBg\"\n       sourceTitle=\"Lessig at MIT: \\\"Tweedism\\\"\"\n\u003e}}\n\nI would also love to see the entire population of the United States abstain from the next election until we could vote on meaningful campaign finance reform, but that will never happen.\n\n## Reform\n\nUltimately, however, none of the promises made by presidential candidates will come to pass without [substantial campaign finance reform]({{\u003c search \"campaign finance reform 2017\" \u003e}}). Congress decides on the budget, and it is the President’s job to spend that budget. With so many congresspeople in the pockets of large corporations instead of working in the best interests of the citizens they represent, there is little that will be accomplished until we achieve meaningful reform. With {{\u003c person name=\"Ted Cruz\" \u003e}} taking money from the Oil \u0026 Coal industries, with {{\u003c person name=\"Hillary Clinton\" \u003e}} taking money from Wall Street, and with {{\u003c person name=\"Donald Trump\" \u003e}} taking money from the KKK, we’re all in big trouble.\n\n[Citizen-funded elections]({{\u003c wayback \"http://lessig2016.us/the-plan/\" \u003e}}) is the only way to achieve this.\n\n## P.S.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/hugo/posts/2016/check-their-facts.jpg\" figure=\"Photo by Jeff Gates. https://www.flickr.com/photos/outtacontext/8046789186/in/album-72157652056682098/\"\u003e}}\n\nI would rather see the debates on both sides handled like _The Newsroom_, where any claims made by candidates are immediately fact-checked and untrue answers are discarded.\n\n{{\u003chls src=\"newsroom-mock-debate\"\n       sourceUrl=\"https://youtu.be/AF-BZsrtoPs\"\n       sourceTitle=\"HBO: The Newsroom EP9 \\\"Mock Debate\\\"¹\"\n\u003e}}\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"footnotes\"\u003e\n  \u003chr\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"f6 gray\"\u003eFeatured image by \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/diversey/15325678721/in/album-72157647164491333/\"\u003eTony Webster\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp class=\"f6 gray\"\u003e¹ Fair use, copyright exemption claim: Low-quality version of the clip used for the purpose of educating readers about the importance of fact-checking the rhetoric that is commonplace in the American political system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n"},
