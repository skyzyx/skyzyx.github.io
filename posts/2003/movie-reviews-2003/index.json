Ellen DeGeneres does an excellent job as the voice for “Dori”, the short-term-memory lacking fish who accompanies Nemo’s dad along the way.

My wife had to buy the tickets behind my back and trick me into the theatre to go see it. After I saw it, I was walking through the shopping center telling everybody to go see “Pirates”. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom (the kick-butt bow-and-arrow elf from “Lord of the Rings”) give spectacular performances in this comedic-action film. I’m going to see it again this week, and probably one more time over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBottom Line: A+\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"american-wedding\"\u003eAmerican Wedding\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmerican Pie\u003c/em\u003e was, and still is, one of my favorite movies that is reminiscent of High School. \u003cem\u003eAmerican Pie 2\u003c/em\u003e was not as good, but still entertaining as it narrowed it’s focus from 4 best friends to a guy (Jim) who ends up liking a girl (Michelle). \u003cem\u003eAmerican Pie 3: “American Wedding”\u003c/em\u003e was almost as good as American Pie 2, but not quite. Jim and Michelle are getting married. Jim’s two remaining best friends (what happened to Chris Klein?) and good ol’ Stiffler are there to help out. Stiffler and Finch end up going after the same girl (Michelle’s virgin cousin), and Stiffler ends up eating dog crap, winning a dance contest in a gay/trans bar, and having sex with Jim’s strict jewish grandmother. The movie seemed to focus a lot more on Stiffler than anyone else. I was kinda irritated at Michelle’s cousin’s attitude towards the sacredness of sex. Also I didn’t like how the screenwriters just wrote out the other characters. There was no “oh, this person moved to Japan, and this person is in Jail”. Nope, they just didn’t exist anymore.

No, there weren’t any crazy action sequences or anything, but the movie was good overall. A mother and daughter bicker and argue all the time over things that teenagers and their parents argue over. They go to a chinese restaurant for dinner, and open fortune cookies at the same time that both of them say “You wouldn’t last one day in my life…”. Of course, this makes them switch places until they both do something selfless for each other. It’s funny watching a 15 year old act 40, and a 40 year old act 15. Although the teenager vs parent dynamic is a bit over the top (and obviously written from a parent’s point-of-view), I’d say catch the matinee showing and take your kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBottom Line: B\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bad-boys-ii\"\u003eBad Boys II\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill Smith and Martin Lawrence play police officers for the city of Miami (read: Will Smith in Miami).
