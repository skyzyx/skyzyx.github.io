With all of the Day-After-Thanksgiving sales going on, I can get a brand-new system for $80. So that’s what I’m probably going to do.

I grabbed my Super Mario Bros 3 cartridge, blew into it, blew into my NES, put the game in and turned it on. Within a few seconds, I saw Mario and Luigi running around on the bottom of the screen, followed closely by three koopa turtles (with the third one slightly out of sync with the first two, as always).
