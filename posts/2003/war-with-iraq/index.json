If it was before the war had begun, then sure, okay, protest away. But now that the first bombs have fallen, I think it’s a waste of time to try to make the president change his mind. War has begun. Deal with it. The best thing that we can do now is support our troops… whether we agree with the war or not… so that they can get their job done, and then get their butts back home where it’s safe… to get back to their families, friends, and loved ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEch.
