I share an office with a guy named Antoin. Antoin and I have been working together for the better part of 3 or 4 years. We both worked at a pizza parlor a few years ago where I was his manager. When I left to begin working my office job at the produce company, I brought him along with me since he was the best employee I’d ever had.

If you need to staple a few papers together, you’d use the regular stapler, right? And if you had a giant stack of papers to staple together you’d use the giant stapler, right? This is simple, common sense stuff. Antoin just doesn’t get it when it comes to the staplers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have seen him take a stack of papers an inch-and-a-half thick (approx 3 cm), and try to staple them with a normal stapler. After a few tries, his stapler is completely mangled. He’s ruined his own stapler, so he has to deal with it. Then I come to work the next morning to find that my stapler is also completely mangled, and won’t staple anything properly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used to work almost the same shift, during which I could keep an eye on my stapler, and inform him when his papers needed the “big stapler”. I had the same stapler for a year-and-a-half with no problems. These days, we work nearly opposing shifts, so I am not as able to oversee the use of my stapler by other people. I have now gone through 13 staplers in the last 3 months. He’s my friend… a good friend at that… but I’m going to kill him if he ever touches my stapler again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went online and found a picture of Milton’s face, as well as a picture of the Emporer and the Llama from “The Emporer’s New Groove”. I created a label out of them with the words “MY STAPLER.
