I was browsing the Macromedia website when I came across it, and I thought it looked interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the features that they have is a listing of movies playing, and movie times in your area. “That’s awfully useful”, I thought, \u0026ldquo;but it would be better for me if this information was available as an RSS feed of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did a bit of digging around, and looked up some movie and video rental sites, when I decided to visit \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040401235306/http://www.blockbuster.com\"\u003eBlockbuster.com\u003c/a\u003e. For those not familiar, Blockbuster is a major retail video chain that rents and sells movies on VHS and DVD. I worked for them back in High School as a front counter guy, but got fired for breaking up with my girlfriend (who was also an employee).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/img/blockbuster.png\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I’ve never particularly cared for Blockbuster’s website. It’s never been very useful to me. Nonetheless, I figured I’d go looking for a list of RSS feeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I hunted around for the “Contact Us” link, and came across a form. This form asked for tons of information, including my name, address, phone number, etc. I hesitated to fill it out because I felt it was unnecessary in order to make a website suggestion. I was about to fill in the information anyways when I looked at the URL and realized that they weren’t using \u003ccode\u003ehttps://\u003c/code\u003e. Shocked, at the request for this kind of information without a secure server, I decided to dig through the source code to see if by some freakish chance that the email address was listed. Sure enough, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fired up Thunderbird, and tapped out the following email:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Whom It May Concern:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy initial suggestion was to implement RSS feeds into your website, so that those of us who use RSS Readers to check the latest information from the internet might be able to see what the New Releases and Upcoming Releases are. It would be terribly helpful, and I might be more likely to rent or buy movies from you than I am right now. It’s a hassle to try and remember to visit your website to see what’s just coming out, and getting promotional or advertising email is just plain irritating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I went to fill out your contact form, I realized that you guys are asking for some very sensitive information, and you’re not even using a secure server (https://). Being a web designer, I simply looked at the source code in hopes of finding an email address, which I did. Personally, I don’t believe that I should have to give you all of my personally identifyable information to you, just to ask a question or make a comment. Secondly, if you ARE going to REQUIRE it, use a secure server — at the VERY least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also find the text on your website more difficult to read than necessary. Luckily, I use the Mozilla browser, so a simple CTRL+[Plus] will raise the text size a bit. Viewing your site in Internet Explorer for Windows, it is impossible to increase the size of the text. This is definitely a usability drawback. Perhaps it would be useful to implement a widget that allows users to switch between your normal stylesheet, and one where the fonts are larger. This allows you to bypass the flaws in IE/Win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, your overall code could use an update too. You’re still using extensive tables for layout purposes. Tables are bandwidth hogs. The onyl reason to keep them would be for Netscape 4.x users, but those are down to a mere 0.4% as of March 2004 statistics. There are more people using Palm’s, PocketPC’s, and WebTV than there are using Netscape 4.x. Switching to either valid HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 Transitional for markup, and using CSS for any and all layout purposes, you’d be able to slash your source code by a good 60–70% (just by eyeballing your source). Do you know how much this will save you in bandwidth costs? I’m sure you get millions of hits per day. This savings could really add up for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother benefit for switching to standards-compliant code would be that users of non-standard devices (including PDA’s, web-enabled cell phones, blind or otherwise disabled users) would still be able to access a text-only or slightly styled page, and your site would be more accessible to these people. I’m sure that they like to spend money at your stores too, and I’m also sure that they care more about being able to access and use the information from your website, rather than being shut-out because they don’t use the same types of browsers or computers that the rest of us do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d like to suggest a few articles that could really help you improve your mindset when it comes to the web, and how that enlightened mindset can truly help your customers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040401235306/http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php\"\u003eThe Business Value of Web Standards\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eby Jeffrey Veen\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040401235306/http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/why-web-standards/\"\u003eThe Business Benefits of Web Standards\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eby Tristan Nitot\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040401235306/http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/07/WebAgency-Requirements\"\u003eBuy Standards-Compliant Websites\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eby Dominique Hazaël-Massieux\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040401235306/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/seo/\"\u003eUsing XHTML/CSS for an Effective SEO Campaign\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003eby Brandon Olejniczak\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not my intention to harass you or belittle your work, but I thought you guys might be able to appreciate some valid customer feedback on the usability of your website.
