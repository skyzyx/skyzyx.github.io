I did two things with this. Since the protocol is the same as \u003ccode\u003ehttp://\u003c/code\u003e anyways (it’s designed to help feed readers subscribe a feed), I have the RSS Reader strip out the \u003ccode\u003efeed://\u003c/code\u003e, and replace it with \u003ccode\u003ehttp://\u003c/code\u003e so that Magpie can parse it. The other thing I did was add an option to subscribe to a particular feed on that feed’s page (i.e. \u003ca href=\"/rss/?feed=http://www.zeldman.com/feed/zeldman.xml\"\u003eZeldman\u003c/a\u003e). This should be fairly convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing that I’ve made an attempt to support is auto-detection of RSS feeds.
