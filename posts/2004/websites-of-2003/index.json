I owe much to this man.\n\n## [**What Do I Know?**]({{% wayback \"http://www.whatdoiknow.org/\" %}})\n\nTodd Dominey has been an inspiration for minimalist design for me. His site is clean, his voice is strong, and his work is brilliant. Another must-read.\n\n## [**Whitespace**]({{% wayback \"http://www.9rules.com/whitespace/\" %}})\n\nThis is definitely the break-out website of the year. There are not enough good things that I can possibly say about this man’s website. His work with Whitespace and the [CSS Vault]({{% wayback \"http://www.9rules.com/cssvault/\" %}}) has gained recognition from some of the biggest names in the industry. Keep it up!\n\nHappy 2004 to everyone. May the new year bring you joy, happiness, and the correct year on all of your checks. God bless!\n\nP.S. One of the sites I must say I’m looking forward to in 2004 is the one from David House. According to [comments he’s made]({{% wayback \"http://www.9rules.com/whitespace/our_thoughts/goals_for_2004.php#comments\" %}}) he’ll probably have a website up sometime in the spring. We read and comment on many of the same blogs, and we both participate frequently on [Coding Forums]({{% wayback \"http://www.codingforums.com\" %}}). From what I’ve seen from him so far (pre-website), I’m expecting many good things to come from him. Watch the design community for his name in the upcoming months: David House. =)\n"},
