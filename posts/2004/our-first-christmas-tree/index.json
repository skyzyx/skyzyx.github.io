I walked in and found the perfect tree… a 7-foot Noble Fir. My wife looked at me, squinted, and asked what I was doing. I told her that this was the perfect tree for our place. She shook her head, and took me over to the ugly Douglas trees. She insisted on a Douglas, I insisted on a Noble. We ended up walking out with a Noble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, we went to go get the decorations for our new tree. I like the larger colored bulbs, and the round Christmas balls. She likes to use all of the crap ornaments that she’s collected since she was a little girl. We ended up deciding that we would trade off every other year. I would take this first year, and next year she can decorate her ugly tree however she wants to… and that’s fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we finally got our awesome Noble Fir with the round balls up and set.
