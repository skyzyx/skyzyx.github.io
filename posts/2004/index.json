No. We may see what others see in him. Or we may hear what some say he said. But until we see him for ourselves, until our own sight is given, we may think we see him, having in reality seen only a hazy form in the gray semidarkness.\n\u003e\n\u003e Have you seen him?\n\u003e\n\u003e Have you caught a glimpse of His Majesty? A word is placed in a receptive crevice of your heart that causes you, ever so briefly, to see his face. You hear a verse read in a tone you’d never heard, or explained in a way you’d never thought, and one more piece of the puzzle falls into place. Someone touches your painful spirit as only one sent from him could do… and there he is.\n\u003e\n\u003e Jesus.\n\u003e\n\u003e The man. The bronzed Galilean who spoke with such thunderous authority and loved with such childlike humility.\n\u003e\n\u003e The God. The one who claimed to be older than time and greater than death.\n\u003e\n\u003e Gone is the pomp of religion; dissipated is the fog of theology. Momentarily lifted is the opaque curtain of controversy and opinion. Erased are our own blinding errors and egotism. And there he stands.\n\u003e\n\u003e Jesus.\n\u003e\n\u003e Have you seen him?\n\nAnd he is the reason why we celebrate. How awesome a friend he is. And when a fantastically awesome friend of yours has a birthday, you want to celebrate in his honor. And that is what Christmas is about. Not about capitalism, and whining kids, or even about the tree and the lights, but about the birthday of Jesus Christ, the one true living God.\n\nHe is truly great, and that’s why we celebrate this season every year. I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas, and that you all remember that beyond the tinsel, lights, and presents, it all comes down to Christ.\n"},

Using `$x` as my counter variable, I decided to display only the most recent 15 entries. If you want to display all entries in the feed, you can use the `get_item_quantity($rss)` function.\n\nAs a backup plan, I like to add a short message for when the feed isn’t working. In my case, I said that “The del.icio.us feed is not currently available.” Simple and to-the-point.\n\nNext, you want to tell everybody how you made all of this really cool stuff happen by linking back to the SimplePie project page. The easiest way is with the `sp_linkback()` function.\n\nThere! You should now have a fully-functional del.icio.us sidebar right there in your website.\n"},

Not that Christmas isn’t an important celebration—it very much is—I just haven’t been that excited for a while.\n\nAnyways, here’s to our first Christmas together in our own place. I hope that everyone else has an easier time preparing for Christmas than I have this year. =)\n\n## Update\n\nI’m retarded. [My wife is right.](/archives/000358.php) After being challenged and Googling for pictures, it was in fact the Douglas that I liked. Besides that, we got the good tree… whatever it’s called.\n"},

I’ve also finally gotten around to adding the [MackHosting.com]({{% wayback \"http://www.mackhosting.com\" %}}) mirror. Chris at MackHosting.com has turned out to be a cool guy that I’ve gotten a chance to talk to a bit via IM. Although he’s not a weblogger, he does offer really good small business hosting plans (100 MB space and 1GB transfer for $30/year). Go give his website some love.\n\nI’ve also been contacted by someone who knows how to enable conditional comments in the Standalone IE’s. I’ve really been lagging on getting this information out to the public, but I’m hoping to get to it this weekend. Keep an eye out.\n\n## Update\n\nI figured out how to get Bit Torrent setup, so you can now download these files via BT too!\n"},

This release adds support for RSS and Atom auto-discovery, converting relative-to-the-root URL’s into absolute URL’s (like web browsers do), an improved caching process, and a variety of fixes to aid compatibility with poorly written feeds.\n\nSimplePie takes a very Apple-esque approach to feed parsing. Coming from the use of MagpieRSS, I decided to create a “feed parser for the rest of us”. One that is easy, logical, and doesn’t require too much of a background in PHP to use it. My background is in JavaScript, so I believe that if you have a handle on JavaScript and can spend an hour learning about some of the nuances of basic PHP, you should be able to implement SimplePie with little or no fuss.\n\nThere are many feed parsers out there that only support one or two flavors of RSS. Most still don’t even have Atom support yet. They all go through and create this whole big array, and then just leave it all sitting there for you to figure out. Maybe they’ll even throw in some caching while they’re at it. Good for them.\n\nWhen building SimplePie, I wanted to make it as easy as possible for someone to be able to use it. I looked at a variety of desktop and web-based feed readers to get a feel for the most used and most useful RSS tags, and then I created a collection of functions for those specific purposes. Going with a Firefox-like mentality, I made sure to support everything that most people would want/need while maintaining the ability to extend it as need be.\n\nAs Mac OS X is built upon a powerful Unix-based core, SimplePie is built upon a very powerful, yet easy-to-use XML parsing library called XMLize. XMLize takes a fantastic approach to parsing XML documents in a very simple, logical way. I was parsing XML documents within 10 minutes of having found it. This easy-to-use software makes it easy for anyone — even PHP newbies — to extend the power of SimplePie.\n\nSwitching from MagpieRSS to using XMLize at the core allows SimplePie to process RSS and Atom feeds at incredible speeds. SimplePie is also aware of some common problems in feeds and makes adjustments as necessary. Does your current feed reader leave you with visible entities or odd question marks? SimplePie automatically handles some of these common glitches, so that the end user doesn’t see anything too wierd when trying to view their favorite feeds.\n\nIf you’re looking for new feed parser software, or even if you’re not, give SimplePie a try. If you’re new to PHP, or even if you’re not, SimplePie can save you time and stress. If you’re looking for a feed parser that can be easily extended to do more than it currently does out-of-the-box, SimplePie is your answer.\n\n**[Download Now!](/projects/simplepie/)** File servers are standing by.\n"},

I haven’t seen Jaime Foxx in anything for quite some time, so it’s good to see that he still knows how to act. Jada played an uncharacteristically weak character, but that’s how the part was written, so she did an excellent job.

Although there weren’t many surprises, this movie was very well written and very well acted. Personally, I like it better when Tom Cruise plays stronger characters like the one in this movie. I haven’t seen Jaime Foxx in anything for quite some time, so it’s good to see that he still knows how to act. Jada played an uncharacteristically weak character, but that’s how the part was written, so she did an excellent job. I watched “13 Going On 30” the night before, so Mark Ruffalo played a very different character by comparison. Overall, I’d say that this movie is worth seeing.\nBottom Line: B\nI, Robot Man creates robots. People trust robots. One man doesn’t trust robots and gets made fun of. One day, robots become self-aware and try to destroy man. Man fights back. One guy was right. The story is a cross between Matrix, Terminator 2, and Minority Report, with the action and explosions of a Jerry Bruckheimer film, all done with the style of Will Smith. Although I personally like character development far more than action in movies, this film did a decent job on characters and a good job on action.\nBottom Line: B+\nLittle Black Book This was a fun movie along the lines of “How to lose a guy in 10 days”, although it’s not a romantic comedy. It is, however, a movie about a girl who starts digging through her boyfriend’s little black book. She ends up getting betrayed by her good friend, loses her job, and ends up happier than ever. Fun to watch, but you wouldn’t miss anything by waiting for it to come out on video.\nBottom Line: B-\nThe Manchurian Candidate A man with post-Desert Storm stress disorders begins to have dreams about one of his men killing innocent people.

        "source":"\nResponses to the release of [SimplePie](/projects/simplepie/) 0.8 have been very positive. SimplePie has accomplished it’s goal of making it easier to create online feed readers, or anything else that requires RSS parsing.\n\nThe only complaints that I got were mostly speed-related. Most people who sent me feedback thought that SimplePie was just too darn slow. Unfortunately, the speed issues were directly related to my use of [Magpie RSS]({{% wayback \"http://magpierss.sourceforge.net\" %}}) as the parsing engine.\n\nSo, I decided to re-write it completely from scratch. I did away with Magpie altogether, and built a brand-new feed parser based around Hans Anderson’s [XMLize]({{% wayback \"http://www.hansanderson.com/php/xml/\" %}}) library for parsing XML documents with PHP. The results were astounding!\n\nI removed all external dependencies. SimplePie is now completely self-contained. Also, I tweaked with the way that SimplePie parses RSS feeds. In doing so, I’ve got v0.9 running anywhere from 20 to *162 times faster* than v0.8. Specifically, it’s a maximum speed increase of over 16215%. On average, however, it only runs around 100 times faster than the previous version. As a matter of fact, I’ve never seen v0.9 take longer than 0.35 seconds to process and render a RSS feed.\n\nIf you’re looking for some RSS parsing software for PHP, I hope that SimplePie will be your choice.

I walked over to a computer by the wall, double-clicked the Genius Bar icon, and filled out the webpage form. The webpage told me that the next available appointment was at 8:45pm. This was at 8:31pm. I walked back over to the Genius Bar, and the Genius told me it would be a few minutes. Nobody was in line, but apparently since my “appointment” was at 8:45, then by golly I was going to wait until 8:45. At 8:45, the Genius asked what he could do for me. I told him that the information in the PowerBook manual was incorrect. The double-zero screwdriver was too small. And although I’m perfectly capable of installing my own RAM chip, I can’t find the appropriate tools anywhere, so I’m stuck coughing up $30 to have them do it.

        "source":"\nAfter buying my PowerBook G4 last month, I’ve been wanting to add another 512 MB stick of RAM to it to bring the total up to 1 GB. I compared Apple’s prices to other manufacturer’s and found that the best deal was from [Crucial.com]({{% wayback \"http://www.crucial.com\" %}}). I’ve ordered memory from Crucial several times and have always found their prices, shipping speed, and customer service to be simply phenominal. I give them my business whenever they can.\n\nAfter two days, my memory chip came in and I went to install it. I opened up my PowerBook manual, and read that I’d need a Philips screwdriver, size double-zero. Essentially, the smallest screwdriver ever created in the history of the world. Reading through the page in the manual, I came across the following warning:\n\n\u003e **Warning:** Apple recommends having a specialized Apple technician install new memory into your PowerBook G4 laptop computer.\n\n…or something to that effect. Digging through my toolbox, I pulled out the smallest screwdriver I had. It was still too big. My internet wasn’t working at that particular moment, so I couldn’t go online to look up screwdrivers of that size.\n\nI opened up the phone book and started looking up computer places that might have screwdrivers that small for laptops. Of the big computer stores, CompUSA doesn’t answer their phones and the people at Fry’s Electronics are dumber than a box of bricks. I called a few of the smaller local stores to no avail.\n\nI thought about calling up hardware stores that specialize in screwdrivers. Home Depot couldn’t figure out what I was talking about, but Orchard Supply Hardware (OSH) did. Luckily they were right around the corner from me, so I took the minute-and-a-half trek over there to see what they had. After about 20 minutes of digging, I found a Philips screwdriver, size double-zero. I bought it, took it home, and sat down again with my laptop. Still too big.\n\nI called up the Apple Store at Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara, CA. They said that they could install the memory for a $30 fee, and that they were open until 9:30pm. Reluctantly, I got into my car and drove the 25+ minutes to the mall, parked, and walked into the Apple Store which was clear across the mall from where I’d parked.\n\nWalking up to the “Genius Bar”, I saw one person in line ahead of me, so I sat down in a chair and waited. After the guy ahead was finished, he left, and I walked up to the bar. “I’m sorry sir,” the Genius told me, “but have you checked in?”\n\n“Checked in?” I replied.\n\n“Yes. You can go to any of the computers along the wall, double-click the Genius Bar icon, and fill in your information.”\n\n“Okay,” I said. I walked over to a computer by the wall, double-clicked the Genius Bar icon, and filled out the webpage form. The webpage told me that the next available appointment was at 8:45pm. This was at 8:31pm. I walked back over to the Genius Bar, and the Genius told me it would be a few minutes. Nobody was in line, but apparently since my “appointment” was at 8:45, then by golly I was going to wait until 8:45. At 8:45, the Genius asked what he could do for me. I told him that the information in the PowerBook manual was incorrect. The double-zero screwdriver was too small. And although I’m perfectly capable of installing my own RAM chip, I can’t find the appropriate tools anywhere, so I’m stuck coughing up $30 to have them do it. He looked at my PowerBook, then at my Crucial.com RAM box, then at me. “I’m sorry sir, but we can’t install that RAM.”\n\n“Why not?!” I asked, clearly fuming from irritation.\n\n\"We can only install memory that you buy here, and we can’t allow anyone to use our tools. That’s our *policy*.\"\n\n“Wait a sec,” I began. \"I’ve been using Macs for 12 years. I’ve spent much of the last 12 years evangelizing for Apple. I’ve successfully convinced 22 people to buy Mac over PC in the last, oh, 7 years. At around $2000 per computer, we’re looking at $44,000 that I have put into Apple’s hand… not including people that might have bought Apple later on that I don’t know about. In the last four months, I have personally given Apple $3400 of *my hard-earned cash — not credit — cash* that I spent several months saving up, I’m trying to pay you money for a task that I am *perfectly* capable of doing myself, and you won’t let me borrow a microscopic screwdriver for *five freaking minutes* because I decided to pay $120 for a RAM chip that costs $400 from the Apple Store — because of some stupid *policy*?!\"\n\n“Yessir. That’s right.”\n\nEven as a Christian, I found it difficult to not reach across the Genius Bar and rip his larynx out of his throat while swearing like a sailor who just smashed his finger with a hammer.\n\n\"Then do you know of anyone, *anyone*, who has a screwdriver that is the right size?\"\n\n“Well, you’ll want to check out some of the jewelry stores here in the mall. They should have something of that size.”\n\nFor the next 45 minutes, I walked from jewelry store to jewelry store, asking the rich women at the counter for a screwdriver and getting nothing but strange looks or blank stares. Apparently, jewelers only have flathead screwdrivers, and not Philips.\n\nFinally, I came across a Lens Crafters eyeglass store. I went through the process of explaining how small the mythical screwdriver is that I need, and was wondering of they either sold them or would let me borrow one for five minutes. Nope, and nope. However, one of the technicians just *happened* to walk by and over hear me talking to the clerk at the counter. “Will this help?” he asked.\n\nI sat down with it, and in 5 minutes I was looking at the “About this Mac” dialog that listed 1 GB DDR SDRAM. “Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou!” I said. He said he was glad to help. I asked him where I could find a screwdriver like that. He suggested hobby shops and a company called [Sadler]({{% wayback \"http://www.sadleroptical.com/Sadler2.5.html\" %}}) whio apparently makes them. I haven’t checked out the website yet, but hopefully they sell them there.\n\nI went back into the Genius Bar an hour after I’d left, walked right up to the Genius and told him where to direct people in the future. He nodded and said okay, but I doubt he’ll tell anyone about it. As I walked out, and older woman told me that she thought it was very nice of me to have come back to tell them what I did about the Lens Crafters store. I told her that it was just because I didn’t want *anyone* to ever have to go through the same kind of frustration that I had that evening.\n\nI talked to a friend of mine a couple of days the next day, and he said that he had a horrible experience at that same Apple Store while trying to purchase a new iMac. He ended up leaving and going to the Apple Store in Palo Alto, and had a significantly better experience. He thinks it’s because Steve Jobs is said to visit that store frequently… which I’d heard before too. I just didn’t want to drive that far.\n\nIf you happened to be inside Valley Fair Mall in Santa Clara, CA on Friday evening (July 2nd) and saw a guy frantically walking around the mall with a 17\" PowerBook in-hand, that was me. If you ever need to visit an Apple Store for any reason, stay away from the one at Valley Fair.\n"},

So, I went into the Options dialog, and set it to open at my homepage, and it didn’t fix it.\n\nI went back in, opened up a second tab, and closed Firefox. When the dialog came back up again, I clicked the button on the left. It still didn’t fix it. Well crap.\n\nI then decided to check out the Tab Browser Extension box. After digging through there, nothing was fixed. Next I dropped into the nefarious `about:config` console.\n\nTrying to fix the startup page, I went to `browser.startup.homepage`. I checked and double-checked the four settings that began with `browser.startup.`, to no avail. I hate filing Firefox bugs, and I was hoping that I could do something to fix it without bothering the Mozilla team.\n\nI finally decided to Google for it. I tried “fix firefox homepage”, “firefox startup problems”, “save tab session and close all tabs”, and a few other variations, and nothing came up. I did, however, come across [this page]({{% wayback \"http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/codes/tabextensions/locale/en-US/sessionManager/tabextensions_sessionmanager.properties\" %}}) when I searched for the “save tab session” query. It gave me the idea to search the `about:config` dialog for “tabSets”.\n\nIn the “filter” box, I typed in “tabs”. This allowed me to find the fix for the problem. I changed the following keys to the following values. Note that these keys all have `browser.tabs.extensions.` prepended to them.\n\n```plain\n------------------------------------------------------------ -------\nrestore_last_visited_tabs                                    false\nrestore_last_visited_tabs_ignore_OpenURL_requests            false\nrestore_last_visited_tabs_one_time                           false\nrestore_last_visited_tabs_one_time.hide_alert                false\nrestore_last_visited_tabs_one_time.hide_changemode_alert     false\n------------------------------------------------------------ -------\n```\n\nProblem solved. Hopefully, this will help someone in the future.\n"},

For those not familiar, Blockbuster is a major retail video chain that rents and sells movies on VHS and DVD. I worked for them back in High School as a front counter guy, but got fired for breaking up with my girlfriend (who was also an employee).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n    \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/img/blockbuster.webp\" alt=\"Blockbuster Video\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/img/blockbuster.png\" alt=\"Blockbuster Video\" class=\"db fullimage\" decoding=\"async\"\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I’ve never particularly cared for Blockbuster’s website. It’s never been very useful to me. Nonetheless, I figured I’d go looking for a list of RSS feeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I hunted around for the “Contact Us” link, and came across a form. This form asked for tons of information, including my name, address, phone number, etc. I hesitated to fill it out because I felt it was unnecessary in order to make a website suggestion. I was about to fill in the information anyways when I looked at the URL and realized that they weren’t using \u003ccode\u003ehttps://\u003c/code\u003e. Shocked, at the request for this kind of information without a secure server, I decided to dig through the source code to see if by some freakish chance that the email address was listed. Sure enough, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fired up Thunderbird, and tapped out the following email:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Whom It May Concern:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy initial suggestion was to implement RSS feeds into your website, so that those of us who use RSS Readers to check the latest information from the internet might be able to see what the New Releases and Upcoming Releases are. It would be terribly helpful, and I might be more likely to rent or buy movies from you than I am right now. It’s a hassle to try and remember to visit your website to see what’s just coming out, and getting promotional or advertising email is just plain irritating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I went to fill out your contact form, I realized that you guys are asking for some very sensitive information, and you’re not even using a secure server (https://). Being a web designer, I simply looked at the source code in hopes of finding an email address, which I did. Personally, I don’t believe that I should have to give you all of my personally identifyable information to you, just to ask a question or make a comment. Secondly, if you ARE going to REQUIRE it, use a secure server — at the VERY least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also find the text on your website more difficult to read than necessary. Luckily, I use the Mozilla browser, so a simple CTRL+[Plus] will raise the text size a bit. Viewing your site in Internet Explorer for Windows, it is impossible to increase the size of the text. This is definitely a usability drawback. Perhaps it would be useful to implement a widget that allows users to switch between your normal stylesheet, and one where the fonts are larger. This allows you to bypass the flaws in IE/Win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, your overall code could use an update too. You’re still using extensive tables for layout purposes. Tables are bandwidth hogs. The onyl reason to keep them would be for Netscape 4.x users, but those are down to a mere 0.4% as of March 2004 statistics. There are more people using Palm’s, PocketPC’s, and WebTV than there are using Netscape 4.x. Switching to either valid HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 Transitional for markup, and using CSS for any and all layout purposes, you’d be able to slash your source code by a good 60–70% (just by eyeballing your source).

I was browsing the Macromedia website when I came across it, and I thought it looked interesting.\nOne of the features that they have is a listing of movies playing, and movie times in your area. “That’s awfully useful”, I thought, \u0026ldquo;but it would be better for me if this information was available as an RSS feed of some sort.\nI did a bit of digging around, and looked up some movie and video rental sites, when I decided to visit Blockbuster.com.

I worked for them back in High School as a front counter guy, but got fired for breaking up with my girlfriend (who was also an employee).\n  Anyways, I’ve never particularly cared for Blockbuster’s website. It’s never been very useful to me. Nonetheless, I figured I’d go looking for a list of RSS feeds.\nNothing.\nSo, I hunted around for the “Contact Us” link, and came across a form. This form asked for tons of information, including my name, address, phone number, etc. I hesitated to fill it out because I felt it was unnecessary in order to make a website suggestion. I was about to fill in the information anyways when I looked at the URL and realized that they weren’t using https://. Shocked, at the request for this kind of information without a secure server, I decided to dig through the source code to see if by some freakish chance that the email address was listed. Sure enough, it was.\nI fired up Thunderbird, and tapped out the following email:\n To Whom It May Concern:\nMy initial suggestion was to implement RSS feeds into your website, so that those of us who use RSS Readers to check the latest information from the internet might be able to see what the New Releases and Upcoming Releases are. It would be terribly helpful, and I might be more likely to rent or buy movies from you than I am right now. It’s a hassle to try and remember to visit your website to see what’s just coming out, and getting promotional or advertising email is just plain irritating.\nBut as I went to fill out your contact form, I realized that you guys are asking for some very sensitive information, and you’re not even using a secure server (https://). Being a web designer, I simply looked at the source code in hopes of finding an email address, which I did. Personally, I don’t believe that I should have to give you all of my personally identifyable information to you, just to ask a question or make a comment. Secondly, if you ARE going to REQUIRE it, use a secure server — at the VERY least.\nI also find the text on your website more difficult to read than necessary. Luckily, I use the Mozilla browser, so a simple CTRL+[Plus] will raise the text size a bit. Viewing your site in Internet Explorer for Windows, it is impossible to increase the size of the text. This is definitely a usability drawback. Perhaps it would be useful to implement a widget that allows users to switch between your normal stylesheet, and one where the fonts are larger. This allows you to bypass the flaws in IE/Win.\nAlso, your overall code could use an update too. You’re still using extensive tables for layout purposes. Tables are bandwidth hogs. The onyl reason to keep them would be for Netscape 4.x users, but those are down to a mere 0.4% as of March 2004 statistics. There are more people using Palm’s, PocketPC’s, and WebTV than there are using Netscape 4.x. Switching to either valid HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 Transitional for markup, and using CSS for any and all layout purposes, you’d be able to slash your source code by a good 60–70% (just by eyeballing your source).

Currently, I’m relying on a modified version of Magpie for the RSS/Atom parsing, but I’m tempted to try to implement a custom-built, simplified, RSS/Atom parser into the new Blogroll system.

I’ve been keeping up decently with the blogs I read over the last few weeks, particularly SxSW this weekend (I hope I can go next year), but I’m still unpacking my stuff, and am still waiting on the delivery of my new computer desk which is now two weeks late (I’ll never shop Office Max again).\nSo, my ever-so-exciting upcoming redesign has been on the back burner for longer than I’ve wanted it to be. I also haven’t had time to complete and release the updates to Blocker I had been working on, nor have I had the time to do any more work on Feed Parser. Grrr… I don’t like falling behind on projects.\nI’m also working on a easier-to-use version of my blogroll system. Currently it’s just kinda hacked together, but I’m working on a version that would be easy for anyone to just start using. This system just reads through my OPML files that I export from Feed Demon, and parses it out to finds the RSS/Atom feeds, then parses those feeds to display content about it. Currently, I’m relying on a modified version of Magpie for the RSS/Atom parsing, but I’m tempted to try to implement a custom-built, simplified, RSS/Atom parser into the new Blogroll system. Really it just depends on my ability to figure out how to implement some sort of reliable caching system.\nI submitted a link to Cameron Moll’s website to the CSS Vault, and it got accepted! Cameron has a fantastically beautiful site. Go congratulate him on it!\nAnyways, that’s all from California’s Silicon Valley for today. Talk to you again as soon as I can.\n",

Everything seemed to blur together, sections of the article weren’t made obvious enough to be able to visibly scan, and so I’ve missed out on some fantastic articles over the last few months. Grrr…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, this morning, I was sitting at work going through my feeds in \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040305223125/http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/\"\u003eFeed Demon\u003c/a\u003e. \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040305223125/http://www.cssvault.com\"\u003eCSS Vault\u003c/a\u003e had some nice new designs, and so did the \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040305223125/http://www.csszengarden.com\"\u003eZen Garden\u003c/a\u003e (you can find the feed URL by looking at the source). I noticed that ALA had two new articles posted, so I clicked through and opened them up in my browser. Drat. Readability is foiled again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally decided to do something about it. I realized that my complaining isn’t going to change Zeldman’s mind about certain design elements, but I can always change them myself through the use of a favelet!

        "plain":"I remember when I first came across A List Apart. It was a great e-zine that taught me a great deal about web design, web standards, and how to be an all-around better web guy. It was great.\nI also remember seeing the teaser for ALA 3.0. I couldn’t wait for the awesome design that would come out of the mind of my favorite web guy, Jeffrey Zeldman. Then it debuted. Ugh. Are they serious?\nBut, as many people commented, the content is key. And even though I’m not too fond of the current design of ALA, they still have some of the most informative articles around to help us all grow as web designers.\nHowever, over time, I realized that I would avoid going to the ALA site because I had a hard time reading it. Everything seemed to blur together, sections of the article weren’t made obvious enough to be able to visibly scan, and so I’ve missed out on some fantastic articles over the last few months. Grrr…\nSo, this morning, I was sitting at work going through my feeds in Feed Demon. CSS Vault had some nice new designs, and so did the Zen Garden (you can find the feed URL by looking at the source). I noticed that ALA had two new articles posted, so I clicked through and opened them up in my browser. Drat. Readability is foiled again!\nI finally decided to do something about it.

        "source":"\nI remember when I first came across [A List Apart]({{% wayback \"http://www.alistapart.com\" %}}). It was a great e-zine that taught me a great deal about web design, web standards, and how to be an all-around better web guy. It was great.\n\nI also remember seeing the teaser for ALA 3.0. I couldn’t wait for the awesome design that would come out of the mind of my favorite web guy, Jeffrey Zeldman. Then it debuted. Ugh. Are they serious?\n\nBut, as many people commented, the content is key. And even though I’m not too fond of the current design of ALA, they still have some of the most informative articles around to help us all grow as web designers.\n\nHowever, over time, I realized that I would avoid going to the ALA site because I had a hard time reading it. Everything seemed to blur together, sections of the article weren’t made obvious enough to be able to visibly scan, and so I’ve missed out on some fantastic articles over the last few months. Grrr…\n\nSo, this morning, I was sitting at work going through my feeds in [Feed Demon]({{% wayback \"http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/\" %}}). [CSS Vault]({{% wayback \"http://www.cssvault.com\" %}}) had some nice new designs, and so did the [Zen Garden]({{% wayback \"http://www.csszengarden.com\" %}}) (you can find the feed URL by looking at the source). I noticed that ALA had two new articles posted, so I clicked through and opened them up in my browser. Drat. Readability is foiled again!\n\nI finally decided to do something about it. I realized that my complaining isn’t going to change Zeldman’s mind about certain design elements, but I can always change them myself through the use of a favelet! I spent a couple of hours writing scripts and tweaking things until I got it how I liked it.

I do remember getting back into my car, calling my wife to let her know that I was okay, and thanking God that nobody was hurt.\nI didn’t know whether to laugh from the relief that no one was hurt, or to cry because my daughter and I were almost killed today. Oh, thank God she’s okay.\nThat was two hours ago. I still can’t stop shaking.\n",
        "source":"\nI woke up this morning and looked outside as I heard the rain beating down on our roof. I got dressed, got my daughter dressed, we both put on our jackets, and left to go to the babysitters.\n\nOne bad thing about Californians is that they seem to completely forget how to drive when the weather is anything but sunny. Heavy fog? Hi-Beams and 90 MPH speeds. Heavy Rain? Swirving in and out of traffic without a blinker.\n\nI always make it a point to be extra careful when my daughter’s in the car, and even more careful when the weather is bad. I don’t want to be one of those idiots that gets in an accident when it’s raining.\n\nI am an idiot.\n\nI was in the carpool lane going about 55–60 MPH when I hit a large puddle in my lane. I realized that I was hydroplaning towards the center divide, and had no tire traction. I applied my brake to slow down, and turned my steering wheel a bit to the right to try and correct. My car kept turning to the left, and natural instinct told me to turn the wheel more to the right.\n\nJust then, my tires regained traction again. My car turned about 140° to the right as I began heading west on a north-south freeway. After crossing three lanes of traffic, and watching hundreds of headlights coming straight at me, with many people swirving to the right and left of me, I was hit by a late-model Ford Mustang, which then pointed me back northbound.\n\nI pulled over to the shoulder, turned around to my daughter in her car seat, and asked if she was alright. With a concerned look on her face, she said “Yah. Okay, daddy.”\n\nEveryone is alright, but our cars are pretty messed up.

I did two things with this. Since the protocol is the same as \u003ccode\u003ehttp://\u003c/code\u003e anyways (it’s designed to help feed readers subscribe a feed), I have the RSS Reader strip out the \u003ccode\u003efeed://\u003c/code\u003e, and replace it with \u003ccode\u003ehttp://\u003c/code\u003e so that Magpie can parse it. The other thing I did was add an option to subscribe to a particular feed on that feed’s page (i.e. \u003ca href=\"/rss/?feed=http://www.zeldman.com/feed/zeldman.xml\"\u003eZeldman\u003c/a\u003e).
