Thinking back, he recalled what his mentor had to say: \u0026ldquo;The key to this business is \u003cem\u003epersonal relationships\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rdquo; Fewer clients, less money. Jerry wrote up a manifesto, delivered it to everyone in his company, and was fired the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jerry_macguire.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe was mocked and abandoned by everyone he knew except for a single client who decided to stick with him. In the end, Jerry’s new philosophy pays off in spades for himself and his client. Instead of trying to be the biggest, he decided to be the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is precisely what the technical recruiting industry in desperate need of — to re-focus on building personal relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whos-the-customer\"\u003eWho’s the customer?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that this is the reason why relationship-building has fallen by the wayside: Who’s the customer? Who’s interests are the recruiter’s aligned with? Technical \u003cem\u003epeople\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003ecompanies?\u003c/em\u003e The answer for most recruiting firms is the companies who write the checks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how they make a living, so it’s not unreasonable, but it tends to cause a breakdown in how recruiters and professionals see each other. The companies are the customers, and we technical-folk are the products. You procure products for the customers, and let the customers pick and choose which products they want — kind of like picking out the apples you want to buy at the grocery store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we technical-folk don’t see ourselves as a product to be collected and sold to the customer. We see ourselves as the customers, looking for the right products (i.e., companies) to invest in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking from personal experience, there was once a recruiter who was very nice to me when I approached her about companies that may be hiring. She had one \u003cem\u003ehawt startup\u003c/em\u003e that was looking for a \u003cem\u003erock star\u003c/em\u003e, and sent me some information about them. I read through it, called her back, and told her that I didn’t think it would be a good fit because they were looking for someone who did things that I didn’t, and I wasn’t particularly interested in their problem-space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe then told me that I would never get anywhere in this industry if I wasn’t willing to grow, and decided to schedule an interview for me anyway. She asked me when I could talk to them, and I naïvely said “in about an hour” thinking it would be a phone interview. She scheduled an in-person interview instead, even though I lived two-hours away. I caved, told her to push out the interview by an hour, and went and talked to them. After the interview, I still felt like it wasn’t a good fit. I called her back, told her that I wasn’t interested in pursuing this company any further, and asked if she had anything else. I never heard from her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of who writes the checks, recruiting agencies typically align themselves with the companies they’re hiring for instead of the people they’re trying to recruit. Out of necessity or not, this alone puts technical people at odds with technical recruiters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"should-you-send-that-email-or-not\"\u003eShould you send that email or not?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things I learned in college was how to put together a quality résumé, and how to apply for a professional job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had the opportunity to have a chat with an HR/Recruiting manager from a local business who explained that businesses get tons of résumés every day, and that a lot of people were applying for positions that they were clearly not qualified for. So she explained to us:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do your homework. Don’t apply for a job where you’re clearly not a good fit with the hope that maybe you’ll have a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really wish technical recruiters would have taken that same course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a game that’s played during the recruiting process called “Buzzword Bingo”. Both sides play it, but because technical-folk have the skills that the companies are looking for, technical-folk play it a lot better than recruiters do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA technical résumé might explain a process by which a very large dataset was iteratively filtered down to a singular result. The hiring company knows that this process is called MapReduce. The technical person knows that this process is called MapReduce. Recruiters don’t typically know that this is called MapReduce. So, technical people will explicitly list “MapReduce” on their résumé so that it can get matched in recruiter databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"pa2-ns\"\u003e\n\t\u003camp-img src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/buzzword_bingo.jpg\" layout=\"responsive\" width=\"\" height=\"\"\u003e\u003c/amp-img\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"f6 gray tc db\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, some recruiters will simply search their databases for “MapReduce” and send messages to everyone that matches. The hiring company may be doing MapReduce in Java in a traditional datacenter, while a technical person may be doing MapReduce in Python in a cloud computing environment. The hiring company is not a match for the technical person, and vice-versa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of \u003ca href=\"/2011/10/26/clueless-recruiters/\"\u003elast week’s \u003cem\u003eClueless Recruiters\u003c/em\u003e piece\u003c/a\u003e, there was a little more conversation that happened after I had stopped writing, where it was explained that that firm’s thought process is, \u0026ldquo;Well, what’s the harm of sending the email?

But not \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is exactly what’s wrong with technical recruiting agencies — they don’t do their homework first before sending an email.

        "plain":"I’ve been accused of not knowing how to do a Technical Recruiter’s job, so I have no business telling them how to do it. That’s a fair assertion. What I do know, however, are all of the things that Technical Recruiters do that drive me absolutely crazy.\nNot all recruiters do these things so I don’t hate them all, but generally speaking, the entire technical recruiting industry has made a very bad name for itself amongst the people they’re trying to recruit. Speaking for myself, and a number of people I’ve worked with over the past 10 years, here is a list of things that drive us nuts as well as suggestions for how things could be better between us.\nThe key to this business is personal relationships For those who have never seen Jerry MacGuire, Jerry is a sports agent who one day has an epiphany about how to radically improve the way his company works with its clients. Thinking back, he recalled what his mentor had to say: \u0026ldquo;The key to this business is personal relationships.\u0026rdquo; Fewer clients, less money. Jerry wrote up a manifesto, delivered it to everyone in his company, and was fired the next day.\n  He was mocked and abandoned by everyone he knew except for a single client who decided to stick with him. In the end, Jerry’s new philosophy pays off in spades for himself and his client. Instead of trying to be the biggest, he decided to be the best.\nThis is precisely what the technical recruiting industry in desperate need of — to re-focus on building personal relationships.\nWho’s the customer? I believe that this is the reason why relationship-building has fallen by the wayside: Who’s the customer? Who’s interests are the recruiter’s aligned with? Technical people or companies? The answer for most recruiting firms is the companies who write the checks.\nThis is how they make a living, so it’s not unreasonable, but it tends to cause a breakdown in how recruiters and professionals see each other. The companies are the customers, and we technical-folk are the products. You procure products for the customers, and let the customers pick and choose which products they want — kind of like picking out the apples you want to buy at the grocery store.\nBut we technical-folk don’t see ourselves as a product to be collected and sold to the customer. We see ourselves as the customers, looking for the right products (i.e., companies) to invest in.\nSpeaking from personal experience, there was once a recruiter who was very nice to me when I approached her about companies that may be hiring. She had one hawt startup that was looking for a rock star, and sent me some information about them. I read through it, called her back, and told her that I didn’t think it would be a good fit because they were looking for someone who did things that I didn’t, and I wasn’t particularly interested in their problem-space.\nShe then told me that I would never get anywhere in this industry if I wasn’t willing to grow, and decided to schedule an interview for me anyway. She asked me when I could talk to them, and I naïvely said “in about an hour” thinking it would be a phone interview. She scheduled an in-person interview instead, even though I lived two-hours away. I caved, told her to push out the interview by an hour, and went and talked to them. After the interview, I still felt like it wasn’t a good fit. I called her back, told her that I wasn’t interested in pursuing this company any further, and asked if she had anything else. I never heard from her again.\nBecause of who writes the checks, recruiting agencies typically align themselves with the companies they’re hiring for instead of the people they’re trying to recruit. Out of necessity or not, this alone puts technical people at odds with technical recruiters.\nShould you send that email or not? One of the things I learned in college was how to put together a quality résumé, and how to apply for a professional job.\nWe had the opportunity to have a chat with an HR/Recruiting manager from a local business who explained that businesses get tons of résumés every day, and that a lot of people were applying for positions that they were clearly not qualified for. So she explained to us:\n “Do your homework. Don’t apply for a job where you’re clearly not a good fit with the hope that maybe you’ll have a chance.”\n I really wish technical recruiters would have taken that same course.\nThere’s a game that’s played during the recruiting process called “Buzzword Bingo”. Both sides play it, but because technical-folk have the skills that the companies are looking for, technical-folk play it a lot better than recruiters do.\nA technical résumé might explain a process by which a very large dataset was iteratively filtered down to a singular result. The hiring company knows that this process is called MapReduce. The technical person knows that this process is called MapReduce. Recruiters don’t typically know that this is called MapReduce. So, technical people will explicitly list “MapReduce” on their résumé so that it can get matched in recruiter databases.\n  Unfortunately, some recruiters will simply search their databases for “MapReduce” and send messages to everyone that matches. The hiring company may be doing MapReduce in Java in a traditional datacenter, while a technical person may be doing MapReduce in Python in a cloud computing environment. The hiring company is not a match for the technical person, and vice-versa.\nAs a result of last week’s Clueless Recruiters piece, there was a little more conversation that happened after I had stopped writing, where it was explained that that firm’s thought process is, \u0026ldquo;Well, what’s the harm of sending the email? If it’s not a good fit, most people just ignore it. But not you.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is exactly what’s wrong with technical recruiting agencies — they don’t do their homework first before sending an email. In doing so, they waste everybody’s time and attention with what ends up being tantamount to spam.\n  Don’t ask for my colleagues’ information We technical-folk are very aware that the way recruiters make money is by matching people with companies. It’s pretty ballsy, and quite frankly rude, when you ask \u0026ldquo;If you or anyone you know is interested…“. We don’t believe that you’re trying to help anyone get a job. What we do believe, however, is that you’re trying to get paid. True or false, this is what we believe. When we read this, we can’t help but think ”Wait, you want me to do your job for you? No thanks.\u0026rdquo; You clearly didn’t bother to do your homework when you contacted me. Why would I think that you would treat my colleague any better?\nStop being lazy and do your own job.\nDon’t call me at work, or email me at work If you do, you are a particularly stupid person. For obvious reasons.\nStick to professional networks There are plenty of social networks that are geared toward professionals. LinkedIn, Plaxo, Zerply, and good ol’ email. If you’re going to try to recruit someone, stick to places like these. Even Twitter is tolerable.\nYou know what’s intolerable? Here’s a message I received this morning on Facebook from someone I don’t know.\n Hi Ryan,\ni have a JAVA position in Santa Clara,CA,PLZ Send me your updated to resume to [email],if you are interested.\n I swear I can’t make this shit up.\nBut you know what will earn you an I-will-punch-you-in-the-throat,-bitch reaction? Trying to recruit me on Match.com.\nOver the summer, I was meeting girls and going on dates. There was one girl who was cute, and we seemed to have a lot in common. We were talking, trying to figure out the details of our first date together. After we settled on the time and place, we had the following conversation over text message:\n Her: So, do you know Java, JBoss or Spring?\nMe: ’scuse me? No. Why?\nHer: Shoot!

Here’s a message I received this morning on [Facebook]({{% wayback \"http://facebook.com\" %}}) from someone I don’t know.\n\n\u003e Hi Ryan,\n\u003e\n\u003e i have a JAVA position in Santa Clara,CA,PLZ Send me your updated to resume to \\[email\\],if you are interested.\n\nI swear I can’t make this shit up.\n\nBut you know what will earn you an *I-will-punch-you-in-the-throat,-bitch* reaction? Trying to recruit me on [Match.com]({{% wayback \"http://match.com\" %}}).\n\nOver the summer, I was meeting girls and going on dates. There was one girl who was cute, and we seemed to have a lot in common. We were talking, trying to figure out the details of our first date together. After we settled on the time and place, we had the following conversation over text message:\n\n\u003e Her: So, do you know Java, JBoss or Spring?\n\u003e\n\u003e Me: ’scuse me? No. Why?\n\u003e\n\u003e Her: Shoot! I have an open req’ to fill, and it would make me a lot of money. Do you know anybody who does?\n\u003e\n\u003e Me: Hold on — you’re asking me to pimp out my professional network to you before we’ve even had our first date? Are you a recruiter or something?\n\u003e\n\u003e Her: Yeah, why?\n\u003e\n\u003e Me: I’m sorry. You seem like a really nice girl and I wish you the best of luck, but I don’t think this is going to work out.\n\nI was so completely *appalled* by this woman’s behavior, that I just sat there with stunned speechlessness for about 20 minutes. Now, granted, this was a pretty extreme abuse of social networking, but it *does* happen.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI generally find that whenever I talk about my distaste for technical recruiters, to technical recruiters, the responses typically fall into one of two camps:\n\n1. **Defensive:** These are the people who defend what they do, come Hell or high-water, and then turn around to accuse me of not knowing anything about recruiting so I should just shut-up. These are the recruiters who think that they’re doing us all a service and we should be thankful for their work.\n\n2. **Understanding:** These are the people who know that the recruiting industry is a mess, and are actively trying to change the reputation their industry has developed with technical-folk. These are the people I’m far more inclined to work with.\n\nRecruiters claim that they don’t have enough time to Google each and every person they send messages to. That’s… *unfortunate*. I’m certain that if more effort were applied to ensuring that the messages that recruiters sent to technical-folk were a likely fit instead of simply blasting out cattle-calls, people wouldn’t hate recruiters so much, and there would be a better working relationship all the way around.\n\n## See Also…\n\nHere are some similar thoughts by other people, which bear a striking resemblance to the qualms I have with the technical recruiting industry:\n\n* [Why are technical recruiters so clueless?]({{% wayback \"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2598-why-are-technical-recruiters-so-clueless\" %}})\n* [Death By Recruiters]({{% wayback \"http://www.codeanthem.com/blog/2010/04/death-by-recruiters/\" %}})\n* [Recruiters suck]({{% wayback \"http://idunno.org/archive/2003/06/04/80.aspx\" %}})\n* [Why most recruiters suck and what you can do about it]({{% wayback \"http://hushrecruiter.com/recruiters/why-most-recruiters-suck-and-what-you-can-do-about-it\" %}})\n* [Another Year, Another Reason to Hate Technical Recruiters]({{% wayback \"http://binarywave.com/blogs/eshupps/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=171\" %}})\n\n## Update (2012–02–28)\n\nSpeaking of people who send out emails without actually bothering to do any homework first, here’s a great example of the kind of idiocy that these people portray. While this person isn’t a technical recruiter per sé, he has shown the same sort of neglect for the details that the majority of technical recruiters do.\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.ryanparman.com/images/aws_rackspace.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nIn case you’re not sure what you’re looking at, this person emailed [Werner Vogels]({{% wayback \"http://www.allthingsdistributed.com\" %}}), [CTO of Amazon.com]({{% wayback \"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/werner-vogels\" %}}), about promoting [Rackspace]({{% wayback \"http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/\" %}}) on his personal blog. Rackspace is a direct competitor to [Amazon Web Services]({{% wayback \"https://aws.amazon.com\" %}}) in the Cloud Computing market. If [Zach Burton]({{% wayback \"http://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharyburton\" %}}) had bothered to do even a few minutes worth of homework before opening his mouth (or keyboard), he wouldn’t have made so much an ass of himself.\n\nThese are the kinds of people that I enjoy skewering in my *Clueless Recruiters* pieces — the people who are simply too lazy to do a good job.\n\n## Update (2013–03–23)\n\n[Matt Youell]({{% wayback \"http://www.youell.com/matt/writing/?p=898\" %}}) has some very similar thoughts on the matter.\n\n\u003e “Tech companies seem to be having trouble finding good technical talent. Maybe I can help. For you, the hiring person who is having trouble finding programming talent, I’ve created this brief hiring guide. It is based on my experience over the years both as a prospective employee and as a person doing the hiring.”\n"},

        "plain":"Inspired by Daring Fireball’s Jackass of the Week columns, I’ve decided to do something similar for clueless technical recruiters who contact me for jobs that are clearly a terrible fit. Explanation There are few things that technical people are more annoyed by than technical recruiters. A very large segment of the technical recruiting industry has made a bad name for the rest of their industry by relentlessly spamming technical professionals after having not done their homework.\nThese people hock job openings the same way that sleazy salesmen hock used cars. These recruiting companies need to radically change how they do business with the technical crowd, and the Clueless Recruiters series is an attempt to call out clueless technical recruiters who contact me for jobs that are clearly a terrible fit. Everything here is posted from real exchanges between myself and recruiters, entirely uncut. Enjoy!\n Recruiter Schlock Here’s one I got today from a clueless recruiter. For reference, here is my résumé.\n Hi Ryan, We have an exciting opportunity with a client in the networking and telecommunications industry. Looking for an overall awesome Front-End Designer/Developer who would enjoy working for a global company that promotes a start-up environment.\n I already work for a global company that promotes a start-up environment. You would already know that if you spent 12 freaking seconds to Google my name.\n Location is Santa Clara, CA. Might you be interested? If so, please send a copy of your resume along with your required hourly rate. This is a 3–6 month contract.\n Yes, let me leave my full-time job in Seattle, and uproot my entire family during the school year to move to Santa Clara for 3 months. Great idea!\n Interested candidate must have an understanding of the practical benefits and limitations of Web technologies…\n ALL OF THEM!\n …and comprehensive knowledge of interface design principles and best practices for content organization, user-centric design, and site navigation patterns. Responsibilities\n Develop front-end code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Collaborate with product managers, designers, engineers, and infrastructure teams to build a quality experience for users.\\ Create a compelling user experience using code polished to near perfection, leaving no detail unfinished.   In other words, be a typical code monkey. *yawn*\n Requirements\n 7+ years of Web application and web service development. Passion for developing great user interfaces, Experience in creating user-centric design. Thorough understanding of user behavior and interaction design patterns   Sure I have these. But if you’re looking to fill a 3–6 month contract, you’re not actually looking for them.\n  Thorough understanding of SharePoint Master Pages, Page Layouts and CSS files Experience with using the SharePoint content deployment features Experience with SharePoint Designer for master page customization, style sheet modification, data view configuration Experience migrating content from one SharePoint tier or site collection to another Thorough knowledge of “Web 2.0” features of SharePoint: Blogs, Wikis, Social Networking (Profiles \u0026amp; Communities) Understanding and previous experience with Blogs, tweets, RSS, CHAT and other collaboration and communication technologies as it relates to social networking and intranet integration Working knowledge of SQL Server and scripting skills 5+ years working with Microsoft Web development tools Microsoft .net framework, ASP, .Net, and C# SQL Server Reporting Services integration experience   Microsoft, Microsoft, Microsoft. Clearly I’m a great fit because I have all sorts of Microsoft-centric experience on my résumé.\n  Java Scripting, Visual Studio, HTML, XML, HTML \u0026amp; Client side scripting (Javascript, AJAX, JSON and JS libraries (jQuery, YUI, etc),DHTML, XSL, XSLT, XHTML, CAML)   Oh, you can script Java now? That must be a new thing. (See what I did there?)\n  Experience with creating content types and site columns   application/vnd.rparman.my-content-type+sarcasm\n  Portfolio that includes sample web-based projects (required)   Oh look, a requirement that’s required!\n  Computer Science or related degree   So… you want a designer with a CS degree? Seriously? And people wonder why I hate recruiters. (Actually, no. No they don’t.)\nUpdate  I’m sorry, Ryan, I didn’t mean to fuel your hatred for recruiters.\n I forgive you.\n The search was keyword generated.\n “MY ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM THE REALITY OF HOW TECHNICAL PEOPLE WORK!”\n I know it must be a nuisance for great and awesome people such as yourself, but for some who may be really in need of an opportunity to come his or her way, who I may miss without the particular tool that recruiters use…\n You’re helping? Really? By not making any attempt to learn about what best fits me? What about paying attention to relationship-building more than cattle calls?\n …your hatred and sarcasm are shining personality traits I have accepteed to welcome my way.\n Ah, see there? You can do sarcasm too!\n But for the most part, my apologies.\n My mother taught me that saying sorry means you’ll never do it again.\nUpdate #2 Finally, something honest.\n Evils of recruiting… really, unfortunately I’m not smart enough to code something that will give me good results based on my 50 mile radius search of resumes (you’re in WA, how did that happen?), nor fast enough to read each and every resume out there in time to meet the client’s expectation of submittals right away.\n The answer is simple: Fewer clients, less money. The key to this business is personal relationships. Just ask Jerry MacGuire.\n I really do feel your pain. I honestly just don’t think that wishing death to recruiters is, well, nice.\n Technical people hate technical recruiters. That much is a fact. The question is, what will you do to change the perception that technical people have of recruiters? How can you be better than the status quo?\n And no, I wasn’t being sarcastic by saying you’re awesome and great and that your shining traits include hatred and sarcasm. They were genuine. As genuine as your displeasure with recruiters. Truly. No, like, really. This whole correspondence is actually funny. Disagreement is healthy and hopefully there is no super personal offense on your part because there is none on my part- though you tried to slice me with your sharp words or make me cower with your ‘wittiness’. (Again, I reserve the right to disagree.)\n No personal offense on my part. Just — be better than the other people in your industry. Prove to me that I’m wrong about technical recruiters.\n Have a nice day. I hope this left you smiling on some level. A grin. A smirk. Anything resembling a smile. I am smiling as I type this. Wait, can we be facebook, linked in friends? (That was a joke. Or not.)\n Yes, this was fun. Let’s do it again sometime, eh?\nUpdate #3: Response from their co-worker  Ryan is just one of those “I’m better and smarter than everyone else” types and spends way too much time replying to recruiters just for the sake of being snide.\n Nope. Just you.\n For every one of you little sarcastic haters out there, we have a dozen people who thank us cheerfully for the service we offer them.\n Good. :)\n We do more in depth recruiting, but [recruiter] was only using a tool that starts things out by helping to get the word out quickly.\n I don’t think your tool does a very good job, then.\n Rarely do we get a reply as neurotic and pathetic as yours but it does happen on occasion.\n Neurotic and pathetic?

Unfortunately, it sounds like you think your lack of research is a *good thing*.\n\n\u003e Don’t worry, we wouldn’t bother contacting someone like yourself again.\n\nOh, good.\n\n\u003e No way we could get you hired anywhere. LOL.\n\nI think of it as a win-win.\n\n\u003e A miracle that you have a job at all with that attitude but I’m happy for you that you’re employed with a market like this. Have fun in your little world where you are the king of the world and everyone is here to listen to you try to be witty.\n\nI will. Thanks. :)\n\n## Update \\#4\n\n\u003e My very gallant co-worker and mentor took offense on my part. Please spare him?\n\nOh, that’s perfectly fine. It simply goes to show how completely disconnected technical people and technical recruiters are. I’m not really angry and hateful — I’m just tired of all of the spam (emails from recruiters who don’t bother to do any homework before contacting me).\n\nYou’re right, I don’t know what it’s like to be a technical recruiter. I won’t pretend to. But what I DO know is that the actions that are commonplace in the recruiting industry are loathed by people in mine. I would love for someone to change my perception — prove to me that there’s a recruiting firm worth talking to, who cares about placing me somewhere that’s a good fit for me, rather than simply trying to get paid for an open req.\n\nThe first step in providing this level of customer service is taking a few minutes to learn about the person you’re about to contact. Whatever perceptions I currently have about recruiters, \\[co-worker\\] simply reinforced them. He can deflect blame for his industry’s approach all he wants, but until he’s willing to help bridge the gap between technical people and technical recruiters, I really couldn’t care less what he thinks of me.\n\nAnyway, you’ve turned out to be quite cool. Have a nice day. :)\n\n## Update \\#5\n\n\u003e \\*sigh\\* I think it would be too much to ask for you not to reply to \\[co-worker\\] anymore? I did the same but he probably would, still. At least it looks like your email is happier now- with smiley face. I’m glad we did that for you. :)\n\u003e\n\u003e Talk to you soon… (and I apologize in advance if you get a ‘spam’ from us again, it’s um, unavoidable, which we do try to avoid, honestly.)\n\nNo, I’m done. Take care. :)\n"},

That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\n Translation: “We’re sorry that we did a poor job of telling you bad news, but the bad news was going to happen no matter what.”\n Many members love our DVD service, as I do, because nearly every movie ever made is published on DVD, plus lots of TV series. We want to advertise the breadth of our incredible DVD offering so that as many people as possible know it still exists, and it is a great option for those who want the huge and comprehensive selection on DVD.\n “We have a crap-ton of content available on DVD.”\n DVD by mail may not last forever, but we want it to last as long as possible.\n “DVDs by mail is a dying business.”\n I also love our streaming service because it is integrated into my TV, and I can watch anytime I want. The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail. We feel we need to focus on rapid improvement as streaming technology and the market evolve, without having to maintain compatibility with our DVD by mail service.\n “DVDs are old and busted. Streaming is the new hotness — the new shiny.”\n So we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.\n “Blah, blah, internal corporate structure, blah.”\n It’s hard for me to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary and best: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”.\n “I’m retarded.”\n A negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated. So if you subscribe to both services, and if you need to change your credit card or email address, you would need to do it in two places. Similarly, if you rate or review a movie on Qwikster, it doesn’t show up on Netflix, and vice-versa.\n “Nevermind that web services and data integration are commonplace across the web in this day and age. Bring back the 90’s!”\n The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n Let’s bookmark this.\nThe Reaction The reaction is overwhelmingly negative, from tech industry insiders and non-techies alike.\n  When I first read Reed’s blog post on Sunday night, there were 245 comments. This morning, there were 11,237 comments. As I write this, there are 21,747 21,872 comments — nearly every single one of them is outraged by what this means for customers.\nAs usual, Twitter is aflutter with comments.\nDeanna Raybourn:\n Paul Medico:\n Ben Zibble:\n Matt Dudley (deleted):\n Imagine if @Netflix and Qwikster combined services… unlimited DVD rentals and streaming. Now THAT would be awesome.\n And here’s my personal favorite, from Wonderella:\n (Bonus: The Oatmeal and The Joy of Tech chime in.)\nPersonally, I’ve not only been a Netflix customer for a long time (since 2005-ish), but I’ve also been a Netflix fan. I didn’t mind so much when they split up the DVD/streaming accounts and started charging a little more. Netflix + Hulu has completely replaced my cable package.\nI suppose my concerns are mostly around the usability of everything. There are lots of third-party services trying to make it easier to watch what you want, regardless of the service. I look up movie/show descriptions on IMDb, movie posters from The Movie DB, stream content from Hulu or Netflix, download content from iTunes, or get a DVD by mail from Netflix (for titles that aren’t available digitally). I would love to see more integration, rather than fragmenting the services even more.\nA Fundamental Change in the Product Joshua Porter of Bokardo.com had this to say:\n Netflix is taking a huge risk here. They’re changing the user experience of their web apps to model the new company structure, not a structure that is most friendly to people. This is an extremely common problem in user interface design. Netflix is in serious danger of breaking the user experience they are well-known for.\n If you read through even a fraction of comments on the aforementioned Netflix blog post, a very large percentage of users agree with this analysis. Almost everybody has the same concern.\n   As one commenter complains there will now be two separate movie queues, one on Netflix for DVD and one on Qwikster for streaming. Hastings’ response is dismissive:\n We already have two queues. The two “sites” are a click between each other, so we think not that much different than two tabs on one site.\n Technically, Hastings is right about there already being two queues. But he’s dead wrong about it being much different. Obviously he’s never watched people use web applications before. Changing websites is not even close to the same thing as changing tabs. When you change websites you go somewhere different, you get a different UI, you’re using a different username, and you probably have to log in. You have a different payment system. Different family members to add. Different recommendations to look at. And that’s just for starters. […]\nThis is a fundamental change in the product, and Hastings just dismisses the concern with a wave of his hand.\n Clearly, the team at Netflix — known for its engineering prowess — has overlooked how its “not that much different” changes will affect the overall customer experience.\n Also, people don’t think they’re buying two services right now…they’re simply buying Netflix. As another commenter points out:\n You’re continuing to make a classic mistake: thinking you’re something different than what everyone believes you are. You’re not a DVD company and a streaming company: you’re where I go to watch movies. That’s it. The future clearly is streaming, but by separating and charging more for access, you’re wildly less valuable to me. I’ll likely cancel. You haven’t listened to customer feedback. You’re delusional and you’re lost.\u0026rdquo;\n  Railroad companies failed to understand that they were in the transportation business and were surpassed by the airlines. Newspaper companies failed to understand that they were in the information business and were surpassed by blogs. Record stores failed to understand that they were in the business of selling music and the were surpassed by the Napster Revolution. It’s a classic mistake.\nCatalog Size, Deintegration and Price-Hikes — Oh My! Netflix’ current streaming selection is, at best, abysmal. A couple of months ago, I was getting ready to move and decided to digitize my DVD collection so that I wouldn’t have to drag them along with me. I figured that most of my movies would be available for streaming, so that would save me the time of digitizing the DVDs that I didn’t need to.\nAs it turned out, I ended up having to digitize the majority of my DVDs because they weren’t available for streaming. I’m still working my way through the stack.\n  Earlier in the summer, Netflix decided to separate the DVD and streaming plans into separate offerings, with separate pricing for each. Despite Netflix’ best efforts to spin it positively, customers didn’t buy the explanation. Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch said it best:\n Raising prices for those of us who opt for both streaming and DVDs would have been fine if Netflix had a deeper streaming catalog. But the gap is still too big, and the price hike seemed premature. Your customers are extremely loyal. Don’t piss them off.\n (Aside: Bill Gurley from Above the Crowd makes a very interesting case for why he believes Netflix was forced to raise their prices. I would likely end up quoting his entire piece here, so I’ll just link to \u0026ldquo;Understanding Why Netflix Changed Pricing\u0026rdquo; instead.)\nA few months before that, Netflix removed the ability for customers to add movies to their DVD queues from non-computer devices. If you look up a movie on your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii or other non-computer device, and it isn’t available for streaming, you need to do the search all over again from your computer before you can add it to your queue.\nNow Netflix is looking to make a move that is making customers even angrier: Not only are they separating the DVD and streaming queues into separate websites, but they’re also separating user accounts, credit card updates, ratings, reviews, recommendations, and everything else. Instead of the simplicity of one location for your movies, you now have to deal with two.\nWhither Qwikster? Back to Reed Hastings’ blog post:\n Andy Rendich, who has been working on our DVD service for 12 years, and leading it for the last 4 years, will be the CEO of Qwikster. Andy and I made a short welcome video. (You’ll probably say we should avoid going into movie making after watching it.) We will let you know in a few weeks when the Qwikster.com website is up and ready. It is merely a renamed version of the Netflix DVD website, but with the addition of video games. You won’t have to do anything special if you subscribe to our DVD by mail service. […]\nSome members will likely feel that we shouldn’t split the businesses, and that we shouldn’t rename our DVD by mail service. […] But going forward, Qwikster will continue to run the best DVD by mail service ever, throughout the United States. Netflix will offer the best streaming service for TV shows and movies, hopefully on a global basis.\n Streaming is the future. Everybody knows it. You know it, I know it, Reed Hastings knows it, and Andy Rendich sure as heck knows it. When was the last time you decided to add a movie to your DVD queue if it was already available for streaming? When is streaming ever not your first choice?\n  Erick Schonfeld of Techcrunch breaks down the numbers:\n Still, it’s not enough to offset the drop-off in DVD subscribers. Of the 1 million fewer subscribers Netflix now expects, 800,000 will be from DVD-only subscribers. The remaining 200,000 decline will come from streaming-only subs, with the number who pay for both remaining steady. Out of Netflix’s expected 24 million subscribers this year, 21.8 million will have access to streaming in some form, and only 2.2 million will stick to DVD-only subscriptions.\n That doesn’t sound like a very large business. As a matter of fact, that’s a business that’s shrinking. Surely Andy Rendich has seen these numbers, so why would he agree to become the new CEO of a born-to-fail business?\nCrazy or Genius? Looking at this series of events from the outside, I can only see two possible rationales that explain why they’re doing what they’re doing.\n They’re bat-shit crazy. They know something that we don’t, which will make all of this headache worth it.  Reed Hastings and Co. have always seemed like a sharp bunch. They started the company with the notion of putting the customer first and over time they have built a successful business around that premise.\n  Recently, Netflix and Starz decided to end their business relationship, yet Reed Hastings said:\n The additional streaming content we have coming in the next few months is substantial, and we are always working to improve our service further.\n I can’t help but compare present-day Netflix to Apple in 1985. The Macintosh was clearly the future of computing, but after a solid start, sales were starting to drop off. There weren’t enough applications and the hardware was considered too expensive. The Apple II, on the other hand, was a cash-cow with a large application library at its disposal. Steve Jobs ended up losing his job over the “failure” of the Macintosh. Fast-forward to today: Macs are selling like hotcakes — faster than the entire computer industry — and the Apple line of computers died out 25 years ago.\nI think Netflix currently finds itself in a similar position. They know that streaming is the future, if not the now. They are working to grow their streaming content library every day. No, the amount of content comes nowhere near that of their DVDs-by-mail business, but it will.\nQwikster will eventually fade into a footnote in history — and I believe that this has been the plan all along. What better way to sunset the legacy product and grow the new product than to remove the distractions entirely? All of the built-up brand equity is staying with their newer product, streaming video, while the legacy product gets pushed out the back door with a stupid name and a $20-bill pinned to its collar. This isn’t an accident.\nI hope that the team at Netflix continues to ride the fine line between crazy and genius for all it’s worth. That said, I can’t help but feel that in their rush to move into the future, they’re bungling the present. Hastings and Rendich need to take a moment to slow down, listen to what customers want (instead of just what they’re asking for), and make this transition from DVDs to streaming as smooth as possible.\n",
        "source":"\nReed Hastings seems like a bright guy. He handily trounced the incumbent DVD rental giants (e.g., Blockbuster, Hollywood Video), and currently has a commanding lead in the movie streaming market. So why on earth is he destroying what he’s built?\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/netflix.gif\" width=\"499\" height=\"231\" \u003e}}\n\n## What’s happening to Netflix?\n\nReed Hastings, CEO of [Netflix]({{% wayback \"http://netflix.com\" %}}), recently [wrote a blog post to customers]({{% wayback \"http://blog.netflix.com/2011/09/explanation-and-some-reflections.html\" %}}) about some upcoming changes to the Netflix we know today:\n\n\u003e It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes. That was certainly not our intent, and I offer my sincere apology.\n\nTranslation: “We’re sorry that we did a poor job of telling you bad news, but the bad news was going to happen no matter what.”\n\n\u003e Many members love our DVD service, as I do, because nearly every movie ever made is published on DVD, plus lots of TV series. We want to advertise the breadth of our incredible DVD offering so that as many people as possible know it still exists, and it is a great option for those who want the huge and comprehensive selection on DVD.\n\n“We have a crap-ton of content available on DVD.”\n\n\u003e DVD by mail may not last forever, but we want it to last as long as possible.\n\n“DVDs by mail is a dying business.”\n\n\u003e I also love our streaming service because it is integrated into my TV, and I can watch anytime I want. The benefits of our streaming service are really quite different from the benefits of DVD by mail. We feel we need to focus on rapid improvement as streaming technology and the market evolve, without having to maintain compatibility with our DVD by mail service.\n\n“DVDs are old and busted. Streaming is the new hotness — the new shiny.”\n\n\u003e So we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.\n\n“Blah, blah, internal corporate structure, blah.”\n\n\u003e It’s hard for me to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary and best: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”.\n\n“I’m retarded.”\n\n\u003e A negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated.

        "plain":"Wayne Gretzky is often credited as being the single greatest hockey player of all time. It is said that his father, Walter Gretzky, taught him the most important thing to learn in hockey:\n “Skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”\n This quote in particular is one that Steve Jobs has brought up on numerous occasions, and is far more revealing about Apple’s internal culture than I think most of us realize. It is certainly the most salient explanation for Apple’s intense focus at the intersection of technology and liberal arts.\n  Mobile Over the past couple of years, I’ve started paying an increasing amount of attention to Apple and it’s competition — mostly in the mobile space. Before 2008 when I bought my first iPhone, I really couldn’t have cared less about mobile. I’d had a couple of feature phones, then moved up to a BlackBerry Pearl in 2006. When Steve Jobs got up on stage at the Moscone Center in January 2007 and introduced “[…] an iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator… these are NOT three separate devices!” I was stunned. I’d heard the rumors about an alleged phone from Apple, but this thing was simply astounding! Over the next 6 months, the blogosphere worked itself into an absolute frenzy over the iPhone. Ultimately, the iPhone has gone on to be a raging success — raking in two-thirds of all of the profits in the entire mobile industry.\nHardware and software Since Apple makes both the hardware and the software for all of their products, when you buy an iPhone (or iPod, or iPad, or Mac) you know that the hardware and software work together seamlessly. With the exception of HP/Palm ([up until recently](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=touchpad discontinued) and RIM, Apple is the only company that does this. Even Google’s Nexus line of phones is actually made by third-party handset makers (HTC for the Nexus One and Samsung for the Nexus S). In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\nHardware Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  BlackBerry 8800 Research In Motion     Q Motorola     E70 Nokia     Excalibur HTC     Touch HTC     Treo 755p Palm     Treo 700wx Palm    Software Here’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n  Palm OS 5 PalmSoft     Windows Mobile 6 Microsoft     Symbian OS Nokia     Android Google    Queue the industry scramble People in the mobile industry knew this was going to be big, huge, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next iPhone-killer. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first touchphones started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had all of the same features, so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\nThere is no tablet market — only an iPad market Verne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of The New York Times note:\n “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n Here’s what John Gruber from Daring Fireball had to say:\n “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n And Marco Arment:\n \u0026ldquo;There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t nothing, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\u0026rdquo;\n Others are saying the same thing. But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\nIt’s the ecosystem, stupid! The fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n  Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n  Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n  The iTunes Store has over 18 million songs; thousands of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 virus-free apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n  iTunes Home Sharing allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n  AirPlay (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an AirPort Express or support the AirPlay protocol.\n  You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an Apple TV also using AirPlay.\n  You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n  Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n  Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n  Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n  Compare all of this to, say, Android.\n  First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n  Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n  There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has Google Music, but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n  Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe”, “Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says”, “Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them”, and “Warning: Fake games in the Market today”.\n  There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n  There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n  There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n  What Android cottage industry?\n  Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n  Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a small subset of devices based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n  Apple’s Strategy Apple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about the digital hub dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their Rip, Mix, Burn campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n iTunes (2001) Mac OS X (2001) Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001) iPod (2001) Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002) iTunes Music Store (2003) AirPort Express (2004) iLife (2004) Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005) Apple TV (2007) iPhone (2007) iPhone Music Store (2007) iPhone App Store (2008) iPad (2010) iCloud (2011)  All of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\nSkating to where the puck has been Right now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. Everyone.\n  Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n  Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n  Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n  Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n  As technophiliacs, it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. For example, Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices. Really Samsung? In \u0026ldquo;Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong\u0026rdquo;, Zach Epstein writes:\n \u0026ldquo;Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy. The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\u0026rdquo;\n These products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\nSkating to where the puck is going to be Robert S. Andersen recently tweeted:\n Apple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is delightful.

The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™.

Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\nUpdate: HP Envy (2011–11–16 ) If I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new HP Envy.\n  I feel like I’ve seen this somewhere before…\nUpdate: Fun with numbers!

Over the next 6 months, the blogosphere [worked]({{% wayback \"http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1575743,00.html\" %}}) [itself]({{% wayback \"http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/all-things-iphone-interface-and-the-16-applications/\" %}}) [into]({{% wayback \"http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/articles/comments/is-apples-iphone-still-exciting-our-views-and-yours/\" %}}) [an]({{% wayback \"http://kottke.org/07/01/the-apple-iphone\" %}}) [absolute]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2007/01/09/apple-announces-iphone-stock-soars/\" %}}) [frenzy]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2007/06/07/the-futurist-we-predict-the-iphone-will-bomb/\" %}}) [over]({{% wayback \"http://techcrunch.com/2007/06/14/the-futurist-why-the-iphone-reeks-of-planned-obsolescence/\" %}}) [the]({{% wayback \"http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/18/steve-ballmer-laughs-off-the-iphone-deems-it-most-expensive-i/\" %}}) [iPhone]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2007/02/more_crap_from_enderle\" %}}). Ultimately, the iPhone has gone on to be a raging success — raking in [two-thirds of all of the profits in the entire mobile industry]({{% wayback \"http://www.asymco.com/2011/07/29/apple-captured-two-thirds-of-available-mobile-phone-profits-in-q2/\" %}}).\n\n## Hardware and software\n\nSince Apple makes both the hardware and the software for all of their products, when you buy an iPhone (or iPod, or iPad, or Mac) you know that the hardware and software work together seamlessly. With the exception of [HP/Palm]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/hp-touchpad-16gb/4505-3126_7-34499289.html\" %}}) ([up until recently]({{% search \"touchpad discontinued\" %}}) and [RIM]({{% wayback \"http://rim.com\" %}}), Apple is the only company that does this. Even Google’s [Nexus line of phones]({{% wayback \"http://www.google.com/nexus/\" %}}) is actually made by third-party handset makers ([HTC for the Nexus One]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/htc-nexus-one-by/4505-6452_7-33906802.html\" %}}) and [Samsung for the Nexus S]({{% wayback \"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/samsung-nexus-s-at/4505-6452_7-34431171.html\" %}})). In order to properly establish a baseline showing how Apple completely rocked the mobile industry in 2007, we need to break the competition down into hardware and software categories.\n\n## Hardware\n\nHere’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n\n{{\u003cimage-grid\u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/blackberry-8800.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/RIM_BlackBerry_8800/4505-6452_7-32329098.html\"\n        title=\"BlackBerry 8800\"\n        subtitle=\"Research In Motion\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/moto-q.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Motorola_Q_Sprint/4505-6452_7-32327377.html\"\n        title=\"Q\"\n        subtitle=\"Motorola\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nokia-e70.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/Nokia_E70/4505-6452_7-32381755.html\"\n        title=\"E70\"\n        subtitle=\"Nokia\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/htc-excalibur.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/t-mobile-dash-aka/4505-6452_7-32088045.html\"\n        title=\"Excalibur\"\n        subtitle=\"HTC\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/htc-touch.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/htc-touch-unlocked/4505-6452_7-32465595.html\"\n        title=\"Touch\"\n        subtitle=\"HTC\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-treo-755p.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smart-phones/palm-treo-755p-sprint/4505-6452_7-32434432.html\"\n        title=\"Treo 755p\"\n        subtitle=\"Palm\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-treo-700wx.gif\"\n        link=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/palm-treo-700wx-black/4505-6452_7-32058773.html\"\n        title=\"Treo 700wx\"\n        subtitle=\"Palm\"\n    \u003e}}\n{{\u003c/image-grid\u003e}}\n\n## Software\n\nHere’s what the competition shipped in late–2006/early–2007.\n\n{{\u003cimage-grid\u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/palm-os.jpg\"\n        title=\"Palm OS 5\"\n        subtitle=\"PalmSoft\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-mobile.jpg\"\n        title=\"Windows Mobile 6\"\n        subtitle=\"Microsoft\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/symbian.jpg\"\n        title=\"Symbian OS\"\n        subtitle=\"Nokia\"\n    \u003e}}\n    {{\u003cimage\n        src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/android2.jpg\"\n        title=\"Android\"\n        subtitle=\"Google\"\n    \u003e}}\n{{\u003c/image-grid\u003e}}\n\n\n## Queue the industry scramble\n\nPeople in the mobile industry knew this was going to be ~~big~~, ~~huge~~, EPIC. Phone makers began scrambling to create products that could be the next *iPhone-killer*. Motorola, HTC, LG, Palm, Microsoft, Nokia and others were knocked completely sideways by the iPhone. It was so far ahead of anything at the time that nobody knew where to begin. As the first *touchphones* started hitting the market, they all failed. Utter, complete failure. But why? Their phones had [all of the same features]({{% wayback \"http://www.marco.org/2010/02/09/feature-checklist-dysfunction\" %}}), so why weren’t they selling? Arguably, the exact same discussions are happening now — especially since tablets are joining phones in the mobile space.\n\n## There is no tablet market — only an iPad market\n\nVerne G. Kopytoff and Ian Austen of [The New York Times note]({{% wayback \"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/as-pcs-wane-companies-look-to-tablets.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent.”\n\nHere’s what John Gruber from [Daring Fireball had to say]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/ipad_dominance\" %}}):\n\n\u003e “I’m not trying to cherry-pick data. I’m simply observing, based on Apple’s sales data and Google’s activation data, that the tablet market doesn’t today look anything like the smartphone market ever did. The iPad didn’t enter the tablet market. It created the tablet market. The iPad’s role in the tablet market much more closely resembles the iPod’s role in the digital music player market a decade ago than it does the iPhone’s role in the 2008 phone market.”\n\nAnd [Marco Arment]({{% wayback \"http://www.marco.org/2010/12/31/there-really-isnt-much-of-a-tablet-market\" %}}):\n\n\u003e \"There’s an iPad market, and the iPad could be classified as a tablet, from a hardware-centric viewpoint. But the market for non-iPad tablets is about as big today as it was before the iPad, which isn’t *nothing*, but it’s close enough to nothing that Apple doesn’t need to worry about it. How many people do you know who wanted or received an iPad for Christmas? Alright, same question, but this time, for the Samsung Galaxy Tab or any other tablet that’s not the iPad. (Kindles are not tablets. The new Nook Color might be. You can count it if you’re arguing with me.) Now, from both groups, exclude those who know what RSS is, because we don’t represent the bulk of the market. How big is that second group now?\"\n\n[Others]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20110620/consumers-dont-want-tablets-they-want-ipads/\" %}}) [are]({{% wayback \"http://seekingalpha.com/article/289447-there-is-no-tablet-market-only-an-ipad-market\" %}}) [saying]({{% wayback \"http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2011/08/tablet-computers\" %}}) [the]({{% wayback \"http://technologizer.com/2011/08/17/more-evidence-that-theres-no-tablet-market/\" %}}) [same]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/07/ipad_dominance\" %}}) [thing]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}}). But why? Companies like Samsung, Acer, Motorola and others have been making consumer electronics for years. Microsoft has been kicking around the idea of the tablet computer since at least 2000. Why is the iPad (which debuted in the spring of 2010) eating everyone else’s lunch? The reason is something so blindingly simple that you’re going to feel stupid for missing it. Ready?\n\n## It’s the ecosystem, stupid!\n\nThe fatal flaw of Android phones, TouchPads, XOOMs, Playbooks, Galaxy Tabs, and pretty much everything else on the market today is the lack of a cohesive ecosystem around the product. These handset and tablet makers — for all intents and purposes — seem to think that the experience stops at the phone or the tablet. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I [wrote a couple of weeks ago](/2011/08/21/comparing-the-hp-touchpad-to-the-ipad-2/), I bought an HP TouchPad during their firesale. When reviewing the product, I compared it to my iPad. I’d purchased it for my kids so that they’d have something to play with so they’d leave my iPad alone.\n\nWhat happened? They decided that they didn’t like the TouchPad. They wanted the games, the books, the movies, the music and everything else that my iPad has. Now sure, the TouchPad can technically do those things… but its not a cohesive experience. It’s not simple. It’s not easy. When you buy an Apple product — whether it be a Mac, an iPod, an iPhone, an iPad or an Apple TV — you get all of Apple’s ecosystem working together in harmony along beside you.\n\n* Syncing your digital media from iTunes to your iPod, iPhone, iPad or first-generation Apple TV (which uses syncing; Apple TV 2 streams instead of syncs), it all happens very seamlessly with very little effort on your part.\n\n* Industry-standard audio and video (MPEG–4/H.264/AAC) is fully supported at the hardware level for each of Apple’s devices which means that videos play smoother and battery life is much better than competing devices which don’t support these standards at the hardware level.\n\n* The iTunes Store has [over 18 million songs]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/features/\" %}}); [thousands]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/itunes.html\" %}}) of movies, TV shows, videos, podcasts, and books; and over 100,000 *virus-free* apps — all of which are available in just a few clicks/taps. You can also rip your own CDs and DVDs, as well as convert your favorite content into ebooks if you want.\n\n* [iTunes Home Sharing]({{% wayback \"http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3819\" %}}) allows you to share all of your content between all of your devices either by syncing or streaming.\n\n* [AirPlay]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/itunes/airplay/\" %}}) (née AirTunes) allows you to stream your music to any speakers that are either connected to an [AirPort Express]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/\" %}}) or support the AirPlay protocol.\n\n* You can stream your movies, YouTube videos and other video content to any TV connected to an [Apple TV]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/appletv/\" %}}) also using [AirPlay]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/appletv/#remote\" %}}).\n\n* You can control what’s playing in iTunes or Apple TV using your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad as a remote control.\n\n* Apple’s third-party cottage industry is second-to-none with tons of integration options for home audio, car stereos, device cases, sex toys, knick-knacks, doo-dads and the like.\n\n* Apple devices are supported with updates for a very long time. It wasn’t until iOS 4.0 that the original iPhone was dropped, and the iPhone 3G wasn’t dropped until iOS 4.3. Everything that supports iOS 4.3 will also get iOS 5.\n\n* Apps are targeted at OS versions, and sometimes by device (iPhone/iPod touch vs. iPad). iPads can run all iPhone apps (although non-optimized apps run at the iPhone’s resolution). For example, Netflix runs on [all iOS devices running iOS 4.0 or newer]({{% wayback \"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051\" %}}) (everything except the original iPhone and first-generation iPod touch).\n\nCompare all of this to, say, Android.\n\n* First of all, there is no Android-based equivalent to the iPod. Smaller form factors are (so far) all phones. Larger form factors are (so far) all tablets. There’s nothing small and cheap that you can plug headphones into and jam with it in your pocket.\n\n* Some Android devices have hardware decoders for audio/video playback, some don’t. Burn battery, burn!\n\n* There is no equivalent to the iTunes Store for Android devices. Yes, Google has [Google Music]({{% wayback \"http://music.google.com\" %}}), but it’s brand-new, untested, and it’s not a store where you can easily purchase whatever your heart desires in just a few taps.\n\n* Android viruses, malware and fly-by-night operations are on the rise: “[Android Malware Explodes, iOS Remains Safe]({{% wayback \"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/08/android-malware-explodes-ios-remains-safe/all/1\" %}})”, “[Android-targeted malware jumps 76% in Q2, McAfee says]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/24/android-targeted-malware-jumps-76-in-q2-mcafee-says/\" %}})”, “[Why Android Viruses Are Growing, and How To Stop Them]({{% wayback \"http://www.technobuffalo.com/companies/google/android/why-android-viruses-are-growing-and-how-to-stop-them/\" %}})”, and “[Warning: Fake games in the Market today]({{% wayback \"http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kjywq/warning_fake_games_in_the_market_today/\" %}})”.\n\n* There is no equivalent to iTunes Home Sharing for Android devices. You have to sync everything from one device to the next. Can’t store your entire media collection? Too bad.\n\n* There is no equivalent to AirPlay for Android devices. You can burn a CD and put it in your home CD player, or take your ripped movie and put it on your PS3 or Xbox 360 for playback, but that can be an awful lot of work.\n\n* There is no equivalent for remote controlling playback of your media content for Android devices.\n\n* What Android cottage industry?\n\n* Updates? Good luck with that. Maybe the manufacturer will release an update, maybe they won’t. Who knows?\n\n* Apps are targeted at whatever the easiest-to-support devices are. For example, Netflix only runs on a [small subset of devices]({{% wayback \"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.netflix.mediaclient\" %}}) based entirely on that device’s capabilities.\n\n## Apple’s Strategy\n\nApple’s ecosystem strategy didn’t come out of nowhere. Apple didn’t just wake up one day and decide to make the iPhone or the iPad. These products have been several years in the making. In fact, Apple talking about *the digital hub* dates back to at least 2000 with the iMac and their [Rip, Mix, Burn]({{% wayback \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECN4ZE9-Mo\" %}}) campaign. iTunes was just coming out for Mac OS 9, Mac OS X hadn’t launched yet and the iPod was still a couple of years away. Over time they launched:\n\n1. iTunes (2001)\n2. Mac OS X (2001)\n3. Apple Retail Stores (allowing people to walk in, play with stuff, ask questions and get help; 2001)\n4. iPod (2001)\n5. Bonjour (née Rendezvous; 2002)\n6. iTunes Music Store (2003)\n7. AirPort Express (2004)\n8. iLife (2004)\n9. Added video capabilities to iPods and added video to the iTunes Store (2005)\n10. Apple TV (2007)\n11. iPhone (2007)\n12. iPhone Music Store (2007)\n13. iPhone App Store (2008)\n14. iPad (2010)\n15. iCloud (2011)\n\nAll of these products work together in concert to provide a seamless experience across the board. It’s this ongoing seamlessness and support that has allowed Apple to earn my trust as a consumer — something that Samsung, Motorola, RIM or Google hasn’t yet earned.\n\n## Skating to where the puck has been\n\nRight now, everyone in the entire industry is chasing Apple. *Everyone.*\n\n* Microsoft was chasing Apple with Windows Vista and Windows 7 (although with Windows 8, they’ve decided to go to crazy-town).\n\n* Google, RIM and Nokia are chasing Apple with Android, BlackBerry OS and Meego, respectively.\n\n* Google, Acer, Samsung, Sony, Lenovo and others are chasing Apple in ultra-portable notebooks.\n\n* Motorola, RIM, HP, Samsung and others are chasing Apple in tablets.\n\nAs [technophiliacs]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Technophilia\" %}}), it’s easy for us to go down a rat hole about this tech or that tech (see: iOS v. Android flame wars). Aside from Apple (and arguably HP/Palm), vendors have a bad habit of shipping second-rate products in a variety of (mostly incompatible) configurations using a marketing strategy that is equivalent to *throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.* For example, [Samsung now offers 2.8, 3.2, 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.5, 5, 7, 7.7, 8.9, and 10.1-inch Android devices]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/109241074429603840\" %}}). Really Samsung? In \"[Dear tablet makers: You’re doing it wrong]({{% wayback \"http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/09/dear-tablet-makers-youre-doing-it-wrong/\" %}})\", Zach Epstein writes:\n\n\u003e \"Repeated cold and lukewarm launches will either push vendors out of the tablet space or open their eyes. Consumers don’t need oversized smartphones. I’ll type these all-too important words a second time: *slapping Android on a slate and shoving it out to market simply isn’t an effective strategy.* The real problem might be that OEMs are looking at Android wrong. What might happen if vendors stop rushing duds out to market and actually concentrate on using Android as a platform rather than a complete solution?\"\n\nThese products are soulless knock-offs of the original. Apple put its heart and soul into the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and it shows.\n\n## Skating to where the puck is going to be\n\nRobert S. Andersen recently [tweeted]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/rsa/status/106977599183527936\" %}}):\n\n{{\u003c tweet 106977599183527936 \u003e}}\n\nApple has invested in constantly growing and constantly improving its ecosystem of products so that they all work together in concert. The experience is *delightful*. It’s not that Google, Samsung, Motorola, RIM and others aren’t competing — it’s that they’re not even playing Apple’s game. Apple’s game is one of putting the user’s experience first, eliminating as much frustration from the process as possible.\n\nIf you put the customer first, the sales will come. If you put making the sale (or grabbing at market share) ahead of the customer experience, you’re no better than a used car salesman. How many used car salesmen are you excited to buy from again? I’m going to end with a quote from one of my favorite shows, [Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip\" %}}):\n\n\u003e **Harriet:** I got a laugh at the table read when I asked for the butter in the dinner sketch. I didn’t get it at the dress. What did I do wrong?\n\u003e\n\u003e **Matt:** That’s one laugh out of thirty you’re going to get tonight.\n\u003e\n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do wrong?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the laugh.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Harriet:** What did I do at the table read?\n\u003e \n\u003e **Matt:** You asked for the butter.\n\nIf you’re a tech company, let me give you a piece of advice: Stop trying to be Apple. Nobody is Apple but Apple. Be yourself. If you suck, if you’re boring, then don’t expect your date to like you. The only way to even come close to competing with Apple is to start working on your overall ecosystem of products. Make them seamless. Make them compatible. Make them Just Work™. Building knock-off hardware and slapping a second-rate OS on it won’t help you compete.\n\nYes, you might have enough checkboxes in the feature list to pick up a sale. Congratulations. But they’re not buying your product for you — they’re buying it because it’s close enough to an Apple product for what they need. Think about that for a second and tell me how sad that makes you feel about yourself.\n\n## Update: HP Envy ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–16\"\u003e}})\n\nIf I forgot to add them before, let’s go ahead and add HP to the list of Apple wannabes. They just released the new [HP Envy]({{% wayback \"http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/16/2564285/hp-envy-15-and-17-press-photos\" %}}).\n\n{{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/hp-envy.jpg\"\u003e}}\n\nI feel like I’ve [seen this somewhere before]({{% wayback \"http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/\" %}})…\n\n## Update: Fun with numbers! ({{\u003cdate \"2011–11–24\"\u003e}})\n\nIn his piece entitled “[Fun With Numbers]({{% wayback \"http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers\" %}})”, John Gruber from *Daring Fireball* analyzes an [NPD Group report]({{% wayback \"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b\" %}}) about tablet sell-through numbers (i.e., *real* sales numbers to consumers, not the fake *we-shipped-zillions-to-stores-but-don’t-know-who-actually-bought-them* numbers).\n\n\u003e That’s one way to put it. [Another way]({{% wayback \"https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/139517109439959040\" %}}) is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely *considered* an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, *none* of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011. \\[…\\] PC manufacturers are *not* dominant in the tablet space. Companies that provide a complete ecosystem — hardware, software, app stores, movies, TV shows, books and periodicals — are. PC manufacturers are utterly failing in the tablet market.\n\nHe finishes off his analysis with the following food for thought.\n\n\u003e The only thing you can learn from NPD’s report is that tablet market share numbers sure do look different when you don’t count any of the tablets that people are actually buying.\n"},

        "plain":"I currently own and love my iPad 2, but with HP slashing the prices on the new TouchPads this weekend, I decided to pick one up after calling around and finding some at my local Best Buy.   Preface I feel that I should start by saying that I’m an Apple guy; or more specifically that I’ve always been an Apple guy. I was converted to the Mac platform back in the early 90’s when my Junior High school’s library got a new shipment of Apple Macintosh LC IIs. I’ve never really looked back.\nThat said, this certainly isn’t a blind love for Apple. Over the years, Apple has earned my trust by providing high-quality products, software and support that puts the consumer first. That doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ve liked every single decicion they’ve made, but all-in-all I have Apple’s back because I believe that Apple has mine.\nLet’s look at the competition:\n  RIM: RIM is dead. Sell your stock.\n  Microsoft: Irrelevant in this day and age.\n  Google:\n  They’d screw me in a second if they could sell more data about me to advertisers.\n  Google values engineering above all else. Unfortunately for Google, Design is more important than Engineering.\n  Andy Rubin has as much dumb stuff come out of his mouth as Steve Ballmer.\n  Google recently kicked off a whine-fest because they lost a patent auction.\n    Palm: CEO was a high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod. Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n  Piqued Interest I have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s Windows CE, palm-sized PC, PocketPC, Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition, Windows Mobile, Windows Embedded Handheld, Windows Phone 7 Series, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called The Paradox of Choice (TED video) (Wikipedia summary). The short version is that while people like Steve Ballmer and Andy Rubin are all touting how wonderful it is to have a plethora of devices available, it’s actually harmful to the customer experience.\nSo when Palm/HP announced the TouchPad, I was intrigued. I’d always thought that Palm’s webOS was a clear stand-out among mobile OSs, but the faulty Pre hardware and a poor at-launch partner (Sprint), and terrible marketing all worked in concert to kill Palm’s chances of making a dent in the marketplace. Palm also was in the poor position of needing a serious influx of cash if they were to continue operating. That kind of split focus is never good for a company.\nSeeing some gorgeous screenshots of the OS and devices on Sebastiaan de With’s blog pretty much sealed the deal for me: I was a webOS fan. Unfortunately for Palm/HP, there was no way I was going to spend money on a TouchPad when I could get an iPad.\n  Comparing the TouchPad and the iPad 2 I ordered my iPad 2 at the end of July, so I’ve only had my iPad 2 for about 3 weeks. I also have an iPhone 4, so picking up and using an iPad was effortless. Because of this, the iPad has set an awfully high bar in my mind.\nAfter spending a little less than 24 hours with my new 32GB HP TouchPad, here are my thoughts:\nPros   Palm/HP definitely got the packaging right. It’s the most Apple-like experience for any non-Apple product I’ve ever seen.\n  webOS is gorgeous, with an emphasis on black/charcoal colors, the Prelude system font, and high-quality iconography derived from the circle shape (Palm owns the circle). If you believe (as I do) that a software environment should look as good as it works, webOS is fantastic.\n  The TouchPad hardware is nice to the eyes and the touch. It has a sturdy (although somewhat plastic-y) feel to it.\n  Neither Netflix nor Hulu are filtering the TouchPad’s user-agent string. Hulu seems to maintain a black list for devices (Hulu has to pro-actively block devices), while Netflix seems to maintain a white list for devices (Netflix has to pro-actively allow devices). While I can watch Hulu content on my TouchPad (which comes with Flash), I can’t watch Netflix content (which requires Silverlight).\n  The bezel/cards UI is awesome.\n  Built-in support for several third-party accounts, including Skype and Dropbox. While iOS (and Mac OS X Lion) also has this, webOS’s integration seems to go a lot deeper — specifically in being able to do a decent job of merging contacts together across the various services.\n  The Facebook app (developed by Palm) beats the pants off of the phone-only iOS Facebook app. The closest competitor available for the iPad is an app called MyPad+.\n  The Last.fm app is also designed for the TouchPad, easily beating the phone-only iOS Last.fm app.\n  The photo app has built-in support for Facebook photos and videos built right in.\n  The on-screen keyboard has digits as part of its first screen. You don’t need to tap shift to get to them.\n  Cons   It’s a lot heavier than my iPad 2.\n  The screen and iPhone 3G-ish style back attract fingerprints like its their job.\n  The UI doesn’t track finger movements as quickly as iOS, so the touch/scroll responsiveness feels laggy compared to the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.\n  Actually, the whole OS is a bit laggy. It’s as if it takes a moment to “spin-up” after I launch an application or switch from one screen to another.\n  The TouchPad uses a non-standard Mini-USB cable, so my cache of leftover cables from my BlackBerry Pearl days are still as useless to me as they’ve been since I upgraded to the iPhone.\n  It doesn’t seem to charge when connected to my computer, so I need to disconnect it, climb down underneath my desk, and plug it in to get it to charge.\n  Ever heard of BeatsAudio? It’s the technology that powers the Beats by Dre headphone that are so freaking awesome. Yeah, not feeling it here. The iPad 2 speakers are better.\n  The app selection is downright awful. All of the apps that I take for granted on iOS (e.g., Netflix, Hulu, Twitter, Instapaper, Flipboard are nowhere to be found on the HP App Catalog.\n  While the photo app supports Facebook, it doesn’t support Flickr which is where I have a 6-year investment in photos.\n  Although the webOS browser is based on WebKit (the same engine that powers Safari and Chrome on the desktop and the web browsers built into iOS, Android and Blackberry OS 6), it is much slower than those other devices. As a matter of fact, I’ve been trying to run through the Browserscope test suite for the past couple of hours and it’s still nowhere near complete.\n  The UI doesn’t change between portrait and landscape modes. iOS understands that the portrait orientation is narrower than the landscape orientation, so it adjusts the UI accordingly (see Mail). In webOS, it simply takes the UI and squishes everything together in portrait orientation.\n  Syncing sucks. Even with the HP Play software that you can download, it’s still a pretty awful syncing experience.\n  Conclusion All-in-all, the TouchPad is a mixed bag.\n  I think that the core of the experience (i.e., webOS itself) is a good OS with lots of potential. Remember iPhone OS 1.0? Or even 2.0? webOS 3.0 is clearly a better user experience and I believe that with more resources, webOS could definitely be a contender in the mobile space.\nUnfortunately, the rest of the experience is pretty poor. The hardware — while feeling and looking good — is too slow to be of any real use to anybody. The TouchPad doesn’t charge over USB from my computer (early 2011 MacBook Pro), and doesn’t support standard-sized Mini-USB cables. The selection of apps is so paltry that it only took me about 15 minutes to look through every single app in the entire store catalog.\nWould I have paid $499 or $599 for one of these? Not a chance. How about at $100 off like they were last week? No way, José. But $150 for a 32 GB model still feels like a good deal. Maybe a touch high ($129 would feel like a more appropriate price), but I don’t really have any regrets about yesterday’s purchase.\nA couple of years ago, the kids would play with mine and Sarah’s Nintendo DSs when we were all in the car. Unfortunately, we only had one copy of New Super Mario Bros. and they would constantly fight over who would get to play it. In the end, we decided to spend $40 on a second copy of the game. The result was the wonderful peace and quiet that came from two happy children playing video games in the back seat. Totally worth it.\nLikewise, I bought the TouchPad primarily for the kids to play with so that they stop stealing my iPad from me. When we’re at home, one of them is typically playing video games in the living room while the other is playing with the iPad. I think it was money well-spent to have two movie/music/game-playing tablets available for trips and long car rides. My daughter, Julianna, is also getting to the age where a computer is starting to feel more appropriate, so I think that the TouchPad will be a great device for her.\nIf you’re looking for a tablet for yourself, though, I would definitely say to skip the TouchPad and every single Android Honeycomb device out there. Spend the $499 on an iPad instead. You’ll get a better value per dollar spent with an iPad than with anything else right now.\nEpilogue: Side-by-side Photos In this first photo, you can see their shapes. The TouchPad has a much larger border radius than the iPad. In both cases, the displays are nice and bright.\n  Here they are at a slightly different angle with the displays turned off.\n  Here is a comparison of their thicknesses. As you can see, the TouchPad is roughly twice as thick as the iPad 2.\n  (Photo credits: First photo by HP/Palm. Second and third photos by Sebastiaan de With. Fourth, fifth and sixth photos by Ryan Parman.)\nUpdate: Micro-USB (2011–08–25 ) Thanks to a comment below, I’ve learned that there is apparently a new USB port size du jour called Micro USB. The TouchPad uses the Micro-B flavor, which is why my Mini USB cables didn’t work. However, I would argue with the commenter’s assertion that Micro USB is “the primary standard for every single other device on the market.” I have plenty of other devices at my fingertips that don’t use Micro USB.\nUpdate: Hulu (2011–08–25 ) Over the past couple of days, Hulu has now added the TouchPad to their blacklist. Sorry, but no more Hulu for TouchPad users.\n  Update: Preware (2011–08–25 ) Last night, while I was digging through webOS-related resources, I discovered Preware. Preware allows you to install homebrew apps, much like Cydia and Rock Your Phone for jailbroken iOS devices. The difference here is that because of the relaxed sandboxing that webOS uses, you don’t need to jailbreak anything to use it (Palm/HP is actually quite OK with this community).\n  As part of digging around, I found a write-up by Jeffrey Van Kamp of Digital Trends entitled \u0026ldquo;Got a slow HP TouchPad? Here are 3 easy ways to speed it up.\u0026rdquo; The first thing you learn is that webOS does a ton of logging in the background. While potentially useful for debugging, it also uses up a tremendous amount of system resources. The article discusses how to turn it off by enabling developer mode, installing Preware, and then installing a homebrew package that disables the logging. Also, if you’re interested in squeezing even more juice out of your TouchPad, the article also discusses how to overclock your TouchPad from 1.2 GHz to 1.5 GHz.\n  Another article by John Biehler entitled \u0026ldquo;How to install Preware onto your HP TouchPad on a Mac\u0026rdquo; suggests a few other packages you can install to improve the general responsiveness of webOS on the TouchPad. There are a few others you can install to just make life a little simpler as well. I chose to install the following patches:\n Advanced Reset Options Faster Card Animations HYPER Version Increase Touch Sensitivity and Smoothness 10 Just Charge By Default Muffle System Logging Private Browsing Remove Tap Ripple Unthrottle Download Manager  That last one is interesting. I had wondered why downloads seemed so slow on the TouchPad compared to my iOS devices. As it turns out, webOS throttles download speeds down to 64 kbps. Applying the patch to unthrottle the download manager sped up my TouchPad downloads dramatically.\n  ",

I was converted to the Mac platform back in the early 90’s when my Junior High school’s library got a new shipment of Apple Macintosh LC IIs. I’ve never really looked back.\n\nThat said, this certainly isn’t a blind love for Apple. Over the years, Apple has earned my *trust* by providing high-quality products, software and support that puts the consumer first. That doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ve liked every single decicion they’ve made, but all-in-all I have Apple’s back because I believe that Apple has mine.\n\nLet’s look at the competition:\n\n* **RIM:** RIM is dead. Sell your stock.\n\n* **Microsoft:** Irrelevant in this day and age.\n\n* **Google:**\n    1. They’d screw me in a second if they could sell more data about me to advertisers.\n\n    2. Google values engineering above all else. Unfortunately for Google, Design is more important than Engineering.\n\n    3. [Andy Rubin](https://twitter.com/Arubin/status/27808662429) has as much dumb stuff come out of his mouth as [Steve Ballmer]({{% wayback \"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2007/04/ballmer-says-iphone-has-no-chance-to-gain-significant-market-share.ars\" %}}).\n\n    4. Google recently kicked off a [whine-fest]({{% wayback \"http://allthingsd.com/20110803/microsoft-pr-ninja-strikes-back-at-google-patent-whine-with-email-jujitsu/\" %}}) because they lost a patent auction.\n\n* **Palm:** CEO was a [high-ranking lieutenant at Apple in charge of the iPod]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jon_Rubinstein\" %}}). Lots of former Apple engineers. Sweet new OS for mobile devices. Hmmm…\n\n## Piqued Interest\n\nI have no interest in Android. I’m a bit of a quality snob, and an ease-of-use snob, and most of Google’s products are just not there. Android in particular (and Microsoft’s ~~Windows CE~~, ~~palm-sized PC~~, ~~PocketPC~~, ~~Windows Mobile 2003 for Pocket PC Phone Edition~~, ~~Windows Mobile~~, ~~Windows Embedded Handheld~~, ~~Windows Phone 7 Series~~, Windows Phone 7 devices) all suffer from what’s called [The Paradox of Choice (TED video)]({{% wayback \"http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html\" %}}) ([Wikipedia summary]({{% wayback \"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less\" %}})).

I’ve done a lot of interviewing over the past several years to try and find the right people to join the teams I’ve worked on, and I thought it might be helpful to share part of my process.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003caside class=\"age aside container flex\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNOTE:\u003c/b\u003e I want to start by stating that what is written here are my own thoughts, and not representative of any past or current employer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"start\"\u003eStart\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypically the process starts with an in-house recruiter sending a stack of résumés to my manager. My managers have usually taken a swag at filtering out the ones that are clearly junk, and then pass them off to me to make a determination as to whether someone is worth a phone call for the position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I’m going to start by saying that my approach to résumés is greatly influenced by \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/02/25/a_glimpse_and_a_hook.html\"\u003eA Glimpse and a Hook\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo; and the follow-up, \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/12/06/a_brief_glimpse.html\"\u003eA Brief Glimpse\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;. Like the author, I update my résumé every 3–6 months whether I’m looking for a new gig or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-name\"\u003eYour Name\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been around. You might call me an Internet slut. If you’ve done something notable on the Front-End/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP front, I’ve probably heard of you. That’s already going to be a plus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"address-and-phone-number-vs-your-blog-twitter-and-github\"\u003eAddress and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t need to know where you live. I don’t care. I’m not going to mail you a letter. An email address is good \u003cem\u003eat the very least\u003c/em\u003e. Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live \u003cem\u003eon the Internet\u003c/em\u003e. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/SourceForge/Google Code account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having these — as a Web or PHP developer — is a red flag for me. I wouldn’t necessarily expect someone with a Java or .NET background to use Twitter or GitHub (nothing against Java or .NET developers). But if you’re working in PHP, Ruby or the front-end, I expect to see these things otherwise I’m going to suspect that you’re out of touch with what’s happening \u003cem\u003eright now\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"objective\"\u003eObjective\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have this on your résumé, get rid of it. It sucks. It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, no shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"elevator-pitch\"\u003eElevator Pitch\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch\"\u003eelevator pitch\u003c/a\u003e should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph. Assume that this is the only part of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://noahstokes.com/hot-as-the-sun.php\"\u003eNoah Stokes\u003c/a\u003e’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick Google, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, I’m also a fan of the \u003cstrong\u003e1-pager\u003c/strong\u003e. I first came across this concept through my colleague \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://christen.dybenko.net\"\u003eChristen Dybenko\u003c/a\u003e, who in-turn got the idea from a post by \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://davidseah.com/blog/2008/07/powerpoint-resume-layout-tips/\"\u003eDavid Seah\u003c/a\u003e. This idea has also been made popular by sites like \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://cvparade.com\"\u003eCV Parade\u003c/a\u003e. It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for. It isn’t a résumé replacement, but it’s a good way for you to hook my interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome sites make this easy for you; \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://about.me/skyzyx\"\u003eAbout.me\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110811032444/http://zerp.ly/rparman\"\u003eZerply\u003c/a\u003e come immediately to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"skills-and-software\"\u003eSkills and Software\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkills are more important than software. I care more about you being able to do something than I do about the tools you use to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recommend breaking your skills down into three groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1–3:\u003c/strong\u003e You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4–6:\u003c/strong\u003e You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7–9:\u003c/strong\u003e You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10:\u003c/strong\u003e You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like \u003ccode\u003efind\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003egrep\u003c/code\u003e, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary-of-qualifications\"\u003eSummary of Qualifications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike Skills, which I find to be a total waste of time, I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking. When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the time, it’s a bunch of junk that doesn’t tell me anything. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \u0026ldquo;I work \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e hard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;My work is \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e perfect\u0026rdquo;, I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe? I have a strong personality and sometimes I steamroll over people if I’m not paying attention. If the team I’m applying for is comprised primarily of easy-going and/or \u003cem\u003edelicate\u003c/em\u003e personalities, I probably won’t be a good fit for your team. But if you’re looking for someone who has the backbone to make a decision and commit, and have other people on the team with strong personalities who like to hash out ideas to find the best ones, then I’m likely a great fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"work-experience\"\u003eWork Experience\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to see what you \u003cem\u003eaccomplished\u003c/em\u003e (or where your \u003cem\u003efocus\u003c/em\u003e was), what you \u003cem\u003elearned\u003c/em\u003e, and how you’ve \u003cem\u003egrown\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you list an accomlishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"references-and-recommendations\"\u003eReferences and Recommendations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReferences have gone the way of the dodo bird. The thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light. In that way, a lot of recommendations are junk. Knowing that, I’m less concerned about positive or negative spin and more concerned with \u003cem\u003ewhat\u003c/em\u003e they write about you? What language do they use? How well does it seem like they know you, and what kinds of things do they bring up about you? Do I see a recurring theme throughout all of your recommendations? How well do they mesh with how you’ve described yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"education\"\u003eEducation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally, I completely skip this section. The only thing I check for is whether or not you have a Master’s degree. What my personal experience has taught me is that a Master’s degree means very little real-world experience, and the experience that they \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e have is generally pretty useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, if you have your Master’s degree \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e know your stuff, then that’s great. But understand that you’re in the minority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"other-tips\"\u003eOther Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are a few other things to think about:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGitHub \u0026gt; Résumé:\u003c/strong\u003e A GitHub account is better than a résumé.

        "plain":"Over my career, my job title has typically fallen into one of two baskets: Front-End Web Developer or Software Engineer. I’ve done a lot of interviewing over the past several years to try and find the right people to join the teams I’ve worked on, and I thought it might be helpful to share part of my process. NOTE: I want to start by stating that what is written here are my own thoughts, and not representative of any past or current employer.\n Start Typically the process starts with an in-house recruiter sending a stack of résumés to my manager. My managers have usually taken a swag at filtering out the ones that are clearly junk, and then pass them off to me to make a determination as to whether someone is worth a phone call for the position.\nNow, I’m going to start by saying that my approach to résumés is greatly influenced by \u0026ldquo;A Glimpse and a Hook\u0026rdquo; and the follow-up, \u0026ldquo;A Brief Glimpse\u0026rdquo;. Like the author, I update my résumé every 3–6 months whether I’m looking for a new gig or not.\nYour Name I’ve been around. You might call me an Internet slut. If you’ve done something notable on the Front-End/HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP front, I’ve probably heard of you. That’s already going to be a plus.\nAddress and Phone Number vs. Your Blog, Twitter and GitHub I don’t need to know where you live. I don’t care. I’m not going to mail you a letter. An email address is good at the very least. Providing a contact phone number will probably save us a step, but isn’t strictly required.\nHowever, I am keenly interested in where you live on the Internet. I want to see your personal website, your blog, your GitHub/SourceForge/Google Code account, your Twitter account. I like to know what you think about (Twitter), write about (Blog), and the kinds of problems you like to solve (GitHub).\nNot having these — as a Web or PHP developer — is a red flag for me. I wouldn’t necessarily expect someone with a Java or .NET background to use Twitter or GitHub (nothing against Java or .NET developers). But if you’re working in PHP, Ruby or the front-end, I expect to see these things otherwise I’m going to suspect that you’re out of touch with what’s happening right now.\nObjective If you have this on your résumé, get rid of it. It sucks. It doesn’t tell me anything about you, and it’s usually either a mish-mash of bogus keywords or something so mind-numbingly obvious that you don’t need to waste the words on a page to tell me.\n “To secure a position with a well established organization with a stable environment that will lead to a lasting relationship in the field of technology.”\n Well, no shit.\nElevator Pitch Your elevator pitch should summarize your value and experience in the length of a paragraph. Assume that this is the only part of your résumé I’m going to read. What’s going to get my attention? I see a zillion résumés; what’s going to make me spend time with yours? Should it tell me every company you’ve worked for? No. You are not your job. Should it tell me about the kinds of problems you like to solve and the things you’re passionate about? Absolutely.\nIn all seriousness, the one résumé I’ve come across that has stuck out in my mind the most is Noah Stokes’ résumé. Now I’m certainly not recommending you make yours look like this, but think about the memorability factor. As a matter of fact, as I was writing this, I couldn’t remember Noah’s name. But I sure as heck remembered “ajax the shit out of your site”. A quick Google, and his site came up and I remembered his name. Be that guy.\nAlternatively, I’m also a fan of the 1-pager. I first came across this concept through my colleague Christen Dybenko, who in-turn got the idea from a post by David Seah. This idea has also been made popular by sites like CV Parade. It’s separate from your résumé, and is essentially treated as a list of highlights about you, your career and what you’re looking for. It isn’t a résumé replacement, but it’s a good way for you to hook my interest.\nSome sites make this easy for you; About.me and Zerply come immediately to mind.\nSkills and Software Skills are more important than software. I care more about you being able to do something than I do about the tools you use to get there.\nBut even more than that, I want to know the difference between what you’re good at and what you’re not so good at. I’ve seen a lot of résumés that do little more than list out every single programming language they’ve ever heard of.\n “Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP.net, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, Erlang and Haskell.”\n Bullshit.\nI recommend breaking your skills down into three groups. The names of the groups don’t matter as much as how they’re classified. On a scale of one to ten, here’s how I group things:\n  1–3: You have limited experience with these things — so I shouldn’t start firing a bunch of in-depth questions at you about them — but you’re interested in growing your skills in them over time.\n  4–6: You’ve got a solid handle on these things, can answer questions about them, and would have no problem working with them on a regular basis.\n  7–9: You have advanced abilities in these skills, teach other people how to do them, and can answer obscure or complex questions about them in an interview setting.\n  10: You are an expert in your field. Not just in your company, but in your field. People on the internet know your name, and you get invited to join working groups or hold advisory positions about these topics. You could write (or have written) a book about the topic.\n  Most people should have their skills grouped into the first three groups. I personally give these groups the following names: Highly Proficient (7–9), Proficient (4–6), and Limited Experience Worth Mentioning (1–3). I’ve only interviewed an expert in their field once or twice in my career, so I’m certainly not expecting that out of you. But if I ask you how well you know a topic, and you say “10”, I’m going to drill you like a subject-matter expert.\nIf you bother to list software on your résumé, there should be a good reason for it. For example, I list things like find, grep, and other command-line tools available on Mac/Linux systems. This is useful because instead of saying “Mac OS X” or “Linux”, it tells me something more valuable.\nAnd this is a personal pet peeve of mine: Don’t list Microsoft Office apps on your résumé. If your résumé is so bare that you have to list Microsoft Office apps, Adobe Acrobat or your preferred web browser, you’ve got bigger problems.\nSummary of Qualifications I think Rands says it best in his aforementioned blog post:\n Similar to Skills, this is another skip section for me. Here’s a good example from an imaginary résumé: “Proven success in leading technical problem solving situations”. This line tells me nothing. Yes, I know you’re trying to tell me that you’re strategic, but there is no way you’re going to convince me that you’re strategic in a résumé. I’m going to learn that from a phone screen and from an interview.\nUnlike Skills, which I find to be a total waste of time, I will go back to Summary of Qualifications if we end up talking. When you write “Established track record for delivering measurable results under tight schedules”, I am going to ask you what the hell you mean on the phone and if your answer isn’t instant and insightful, I’ll know your qualifications are designed to be buzzword compliant and don’t actually define your qualifications.\n Most of the time, it’s a bunch of junk that doesn’t tell me anything. I don’t care about stuff that doesn’t tell me anything. If I can’t discern your qualifications from your Elevator Pitch or your skill set, then you’re already in trouble.\nInstead, I’d like to get a sense of what it would be like to work with you — warts and all. This is important because I believe that it’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t. If you feed me a line like \u0026ldquo;I work too hard\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;My work is too perfect\u0026rdquo;, I’m going to move onto the next résumé. Why? Because you just told me that you’re inefficient and you don’t know how to prioritize effectively.\nMe? I have a strong personality and sometimes I steamroll over people if I’m not paying attention. If the team I’m applying for is comprised primarily of easy-going and/or delicate personalities, I probably won’t be a good fit for your team. But if you’re looking for someone who has the backbone to make a decision and commit, and have other people on the team with strong personalities who like to hash out ideas to find the best ones, then I’m likely a great fit.\nGive me a sense of what it’s like to work with you. What kinds of things can I expect?\nWork Experience This is the meat and potatoes of your résumé. For most people this is just a bulleted list of things they did at the job. Again, I don’t care about that. There are a few specific things that I look at in this area:\n  I want to see what you accomplished (or where your focus was), what you learned, and how you’ve grown.\n  How long were you at the job? For a full-time gig, I’d expect to see at least a year. Anything shorter than that is a red flag.\n  At the same time, if I see that you’ve been at the same company for ten years, that’s also a red flag. How could you possibly grow in your career if you’ve had the same job for a decade? (Yes, I know it’s possible, but there’s going to be a burden of proof on you.)\n  Have you done any open-source work? Yes, that should go here too. This is work experience. Just because you may or may not have received a paycheck for it doesn’t mean it wasn’t work. Having good experience here would likely offset any red flags triggered by the previous points.\n  If you list an accomlishment like “raised revenues by 10%”, my very first question in the interview is going to be “how?” Be prepared to back up anything you claim on your résumé.\n  Are you passionate about what you do, and does that passion exude from your résumé (or blog, or Twitter, or open-source work)?\n  Now, I understand that some jobs just plain suck. I’ve had a couple of those myself. How did you make the best of them, and what were your take-aways?\nReferences and Recommendations References have gone the way of the dodo bird. The thing that services like LinkedIn have made more prevalent are recommendations. Without having to pick up a telephone and ask questions, what do your co-workers, managers, teammates, and other folks have to say about you? A link to your LinkedIn profile (or something similar) will do in a pinch.\nNow, I understand that the whole purpose of a LinkedIn recommendation is to show that person in the best possible light. In that way, a lot of recommendations are junk. Knowing that, I’m less concerned about positive or negative spin and more concerned with what they write about you? What language do they use? How well does it seem like they know you, and what kinds of things do they bring up about you? Do I see a recurring theme throughout all of your recommendations? How well do they mesh with how you’ve described yourself?\nEducation Generally, I completely skip this section. The only thing I check for is whether or not you have a Master’s degree. What my personal experience has taught me is that a Master’s degree means very little real-world experience, and the experience that they do have is generally pretty useless.\nNow, if you have your Master’s degree and know your stuff, then that’s great. But understand that you’re in the minority.\nOther Tips Here are a few other things to think about:\nGitHub \u0026gt; Résumé: A GitHub account is better than a résumé. I’ll learn more from looking at your code and the kinds of things you like to work on than I ever will by looking over your résumé.\nHave some skin in the game: I’ve gotten jobs before because people knew of my work. They knew my reputation before they knew me. A huge bonus is if you’re already doing the thing that I’m trying to hire for.\nSound like a human being: If you say “planned, designed, and coordinated engineers efforts for the development of a mission critical system”, you sound like a jargon machine more than a human being. Only write stuff that will actually tell me something about you. No mumbo-jumbo.\nSpelling and Grammar: If you misspell something or have generally poor grammar, I’m going to move on. Sorry. This especially applies to the following areas:\n Their, there, and they’re Then and than Lose and loose And brand/product names: “I-phone” is very, very wrong.  Conclusion Now, I know that I don’t speak for everybody. Some people take a very different approach to reviewing résumés, and that’s fine. It’s also possible that I’m not the kind of person that you’d like to work with/for, and that’s fine too.\nI know that facets of my approach are used by people that I consider some of the best in the industry, and as such I’ve tried to learn from the best ideas I’ve come across to make the most informed decisions possible when determining whether or not to schedule the next step (i.e., the phone interview).\nIf you’re involved in creating things for the web, take heed to my suggestions.

        "html":"\u003cp\u003eIn July 2006, I co-founded a startup along with three of the smartest guys I’ve ever met. Four and a half years later, the company has just recently launched something that I’d consider \u003cem\u003epre-alpha\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’m no longer with the company, I truly wish the remaining team the absolute best. We had some groundbreaking and innovative ideas, and I hope that a real, viable product will emerge soon. Thomas Edison — inventor of the lightbulb — once said “I’ve never failed. I’ve simply found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” Up until today, WarpShare has been — by nearly all definitions — a business failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn’t mean that it will continue to be a business failure, only that the team hasn’t yet gotten to where we/they need to be, even after four-\u003cem\u003esomeodd\u003c/em\u003e years. Starting and running an early-stage company has been simultaneously the greatest and worst experience of my entire life, besides raising my children, of course. Here are some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"your-business-plan-doesnt-matter\"\u003eYour business plan doesn’t matter.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t. At all. It doesn’t matter because it’s all going to change. Tomorrow you’ll realize that somebody else is doing a better version of your idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, you might realize that this teeny-tiny idea you have is actually much bigger than you’d originally thought, and you’ll need to adjust everything to take the modified idea into account. Perhaps you expect it to change. Perhaps you know it’s not perfect. Great, because at least your either honest or smart enough to know that. Having a business plan written down isn’t bad; just make sure that you treat it as a rough draft at all times. It’s not final, and it never will be. If it is final, then you’re either the very smartest or very dumbest entrepreneur in the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re planning to go for a venture capital (“VC”) round, know that VCs don’t care about the plan — they care about your team. Rather, they need to believe in your team’s ability to execute a great idea. If you don’t believe in either your team or the idea, VCs will sniff that out and you’ll get nowhere with them. If a VC firm has never heard of you before, you’re less likely to get funded. That’s the long and the short of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"choose-your-business-partners-like-you-would-choose-your-spouse\"\u003eChoose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just \u003cem\u003eroll over\u003c/em\u003e. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"a-good-investor-meeting-means-nothing-if-they-dont-write-a-check\"\u003eA good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"dont-get-starry-eyes-just-yet\"\u003eDon’t get starry eyes just yet.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or \u003cem\u003e[insert awe-inspiring startup here]\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months. She was a loan officer for Washington Mutual Bank and was suddenly having a tough time closing deals (Washington Mutual ended up \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110407201511/https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Washington_Mutual#Rise_and_fall\"\u003egetting eaten alive during the real estate crash, and its assets were handed over to J.P. Morgan Chase\u003c/a\u003e). Since our startup was \u003cem\u003esure\u003c/em\u003e to be wildly successful in the next few months, she decided to go back to school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead the opposite happened. The housing market tanked and took the investment community down with it. Thousands of companies started shedding employees by the ton. My wife was laid-off and pretty much all of our investment deals fell through — all at the same time. It was the perfect storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went from making $150,000 a year to having no income at all, within only a few months. We liquidated all of our assets and maxed out all of our credit cards to try and stay afloat just a little longer. “We did have that good investor meeting, after all. Maybe they’ll write us a check next week.” While work ethic, determination and perseverance are valuable traits for a startup founder, starry eyes will only deceive you. If you’re successful, you could end up being an accidental billionaire. If not, you could end up being financially ruined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"it-will-take-a-toll-on-your-family\"\u003eIt will take a toll on your family.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we started out with four co-founders, one of them was only there to help us get started and offer his network of connections to us. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in the end, there were three of us who were fully invested in making this thing go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say that startup founders experience really high “highs” and really low “lows.” This is the truest statement I’ve ever heard with regard to startup life. But when you found a new startup immediately before the whole country goes into a massive recession, you encounter far more lows than you do highs. Of the three of us, two of us ended up \u003cem\u003edivorced\u003c/em\u003e. The one who didn’t was the bachelor of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I’m not saying that every startup founder will go through this, and in our cases the startup was not the only factor in the equation, but it will definitely take a toll on you and your family. Plan on it. While I was going through a complete financial, marital and business meltdown in 2008, I would occasionally tweet obscure references to how I was feeling and what I was going through. I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"shipping-is-your-most-valuable-feature\"\u003eShipping is your most valuable feature.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. \u003cem\u003eIf you don’t ship, you have nothing.\u003c/em\u003e Let me say that again: \u003cem\u003eIf you don’t ship, you have nothing.\u003c/em\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110407201511/http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/04/20/10.html\"\u003eRands once said\u003c/a\u003e “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGotten together your initial team.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBurned through some cash.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDone a ton of planning.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDone a ton of coding.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArgued with your team about the right thing to build.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA ton of other stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product. Once we figured out what the product would be, we tried to figure out what it looked like, how it would work, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this point, we were long-since out of cash. I’d taken on another daytime job to pay the bills. All-in-all, we burned a lot of time and a lot of cash just trying to figure out what the heck we were going to do. All along the way, we’d been trying to get VC funding so that we could feed our families and hire some people to help us make progress in narrowing our focus so that we could build something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, none of the VCs had ever heard of us before, and we didn’t have a product to show them yet. Finally, in May 2009 we restarted development in earnest. Over the next 10 months until I left to join Amazon Web Services, we were able to accomplish a lot considering how abysmally resource-constrained we were. The next time around, I plan to do a few things very differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t quit my daytime job until I believe that the idea is going to go somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocus on building the minimum viable product. In our case, we had to significantly narrow our scope so that we could figure out what to build first. We were all so excited about the future that we couldn’t figure out where to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour customers are not venture capitalists, so don’t make the mistake of trying to build something that you think VCs will fund. Instead, build something that \u003cem\u003eusers will love\u003c/em\u003e. VC money will follow the users. In our case, we didn’t have the resources to build something awesome for users, so we tried to build for VCs to get the money to build for our users. This strategy never worked for us, not even once, and in retrospect it was one of the \u003cstrong\u003eworst\u003c/strong\u003e ideas we ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemo, don’t pitch. Again, VCs don’t care about pitches. If you’ve never done a successful startup before, then they’re not going to fund you anyway. If you don’t have something working that you can show them, don’t even bother setting up the meeting. Realistically, you need a working demo to pitch to angel investors.

        "plain":"In July 2006, I co-founded a startup along with three of the smartest guys I’ve ever met. Four and a half years later, the company has just recently launched something that I’d consider pre-alpha.\nAlthough I’m no longer with the company, I truly wish the remaining team the absolute best. We had some groundbreaking and innovative ideas, and I hope that a real, viable product will emerge soon. Thomas Edison — inventor of the lightbulb — once said “I’ve never failed. I’ve simply found 10,000 ways that don’t work.” Up until today, WarpShare has been — by nearly all definitions — a business failure.\nThat doesn’t mean that it will continue to be a business failure, only that the team hasn’t yet gotten to where we/they need to be, even after four-someodd years. Starting and running an early-stage company has been simultaneously the greatest and worst experience of my entire life, besides raising my children, of course. Here are some lessons that I’ve learned along the way.\nYour business plan doesn’t matter. It doesn’t. At all. It doesn’t matter because it’s all going to change. Tomorrow you’ll realize that somebody else is doing a better version of your idea.\nOn the other hand, you might realize that this teeny-tiny idea you have is actually much bigger than you’d originally thought, and you’ll need to adjust everything to take the modified idea into account. Perhaps you expect it to change. Perhaps you know it’s not perfect. Great, because at least your either honest or smart enough to know that. Having a business plan written down isn’t bad; just make sure that you treat it as a rough draft at all times. It’s not final, and it never will be. If it is final, then you’re either the very smartest or very dumbest entrepreneur in the entire world.\nIf you’re planning to go for a venture capital (“VC”) round, know that VCs don’t care about the plan — they care about your team. Rather, they need to believe in your team’s ability to execute a great idea. If you don’t believe in either your team or the idea, VCs will sniff that out and you’ll get nowhere with them. If a VC firm has never heard of you before, you’re less likely to get funded. That’s the long and the short of it.\nIt’s also important to understand the culture of the area where you’re trying to get funded. In San Francisco it’s all about what you’ve done; in Los Angeles it’s all about who you know. Of course, if you can start a business around selling a product or service that people will pay for, you’re already ahead of the VC-funded crowd. Do that instead, if you can.\nChoose your business partners like you would choose your spouse. You wouldn’t just marry anybody, would you? Well, those of us with brains in our skulls wouldn’t. Some people treat marriage like a revolving door. Don’t select people like that to be your business partners.\nFirst of all, you want to find people who’s personalities and skill sets complement yours. They should be strong in areas where you’re weak. You should be strong in areas where they’re weak. If there’s a critical gap somewhere, find another business partner that fills the gap. Remember, there’s nothing wrong with having multiple business partners.\nSecondly, know that your business partners will become like spouses to you. You’re going to spend a lot of time with them as you work together toward a common goal. That also means that if there’s friction, there are two ways to handle it — lock yourselves together in a room and hash it out until you’ve resolved your differences, or you can separate and get divorced. Trust me, the latter is much harder to go through than the former.\nFortunately for our team, there were a few things that helped us work through our issues.\n  We had a rule: If you’re going to crap on the table, bring a shovel. What that meant was that if you didn’t like the idea that was currently on the table, bring a better idea.\n  We were all interested in finding the best idea, not simply trying to get the others to accept our own idea.\n  We were all willing to fight for what we believed was the best idea. There was nobody on the team who would just roll over. We all had personalities who were willing to engage, discuss, argue, fight, throw chairs, and anything else that needed to happen in order to find the best idea in the room.\n  We all valued the friendships that we had with each other. Even though I’m no longer with the company and live 1,000 miles away from them, those guys are my family. We’ve been through the fire together, and we’ll be bonded for life.\n  A good investor meeting means nothing if they don’t write a check. During the years that I was with WarpShare, we had lots of good meetings, but very few checks were actually written. We had people tell us that they loved our ideas. They said that we could be the next Facebook or Google! But when it came time to sit down and write a check, they hemmed and hawed and floundered around. They would be busy with family stuff. They would be traveling that week, so they’d get back to us next week. They would “forget”.\nTo be fair, we were also trying to fund-raise during the real estate crash of 2008. Some of the people who would have written checks had just lost a lot of money in the crash. I learned the hard way that a good investor meeting means nothing if you can’t feed your family. If it were only me, I would have no problem sleeping on the couch in the office, coding 20 hours a day, eating nothing but 19 cent ramen noodles all day, every day. I believed in what we were doing that much. But I couldn’t drag my family through that. That sort of lifestyle was not what my family signed up for.\nDon’t get starry eyes just yet. “This could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity!” It was difficult to avoid daydreaming about what it would be like to own 10–20% of a company that big. We could’ve been the next Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or [insert awe-inspiring startup here].\nMy wife started making plans based on what we thought would happen in the next 6–12 months. She was a loan officer for Washington Mutual Bank and was suddenly having a tough time closing deals (Washington Mutual ended up getting eaten alive during the real estate crash, and its assets were handed over to J.P. Morgan Chase). Since our startup was sure to be wildly successful in the next few months, she decided to go back to school.\nInstead the opposite happened. The housing market tanked and took the investment community down with it. Thousands of companies started shedding employees by the ton. My wife was laid-off and pretty much all of our investment deals fell through — all at the same time. It was the perfect storm.\nWe went from making $150,000 a year to having no income at all, within only a few months. We liquidated all of our assets and maxed out all of our credit cards to try and stay afloat just a little longer. “We did have that good investor meeting, after all. Maybe they’ll write us a check next week.” While work ethic, determination and perseverance are valuable traits for a startup founder, starry eyes will only deceive you. If you’re successful, you could end up being an accidental billionaire. If not, you could end up being financially ruined.\nIt will take a toll on your family. While we started out with four co-founders, one of them was only there to help us get started and offer his network of connections to us. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, but in the end, there were three of us who were fully invested in making this thing go.\nThey say that startup founders experience really high “highs” and really low “lows.” This is the truest statement I’ve ever heard with regard to startup life. But when you found a new startup immediately before the whole country goes into a massive recession, you encounter far more lows than you do highs. Of the three of us, two of us ended up divorced. The one who didn’t was the bachelor of the group.\nNow, I’m not saying that every startup founder will go through this, and in our cases the startup was not the only factor in the equation, but it will definitely take a toll on you and your family. Plan on it. While I was going through a complete financial, marital and business meltdown in 2008, I would occasionally tweet obscure references to how I was feeling and what I was going through. I had several of my followers ping me asking if everything was okay. I think they were genuinely worried about me. I will never cease to be amazed by the kindness of strangers.\nShipping is your most valuable feature. It doesn’t matter how awesome your idea is or how great those investor talks are going. If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Let me say that again: If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Rands once said “shipping a 1.0 won’t kill you, but it will sure try.” Shipping a product is tough. By the time you’ve reached the point where you’re shipping, you’ve:\n Gotten together your initial team. Burned through some cash. Done a ton of planning. Done a ton of coding. Argued with your team about the right thing to build. A ton of other stuff.  You want to know the funny thing? Shipping a 1.0 is only step 1. After that, you have users, customer service, feature requests, bug reports, scalability issues, and a ton of other stuff to worry about.\nSo how do you get to a shipping product? You start coding. We encountered some issues with our business a few months after we incorporated that caused us to have to reset. We spent nearly a year trying to recover and get back on-track with an idea that made sense. After we figured out the big idea, we then had to translate that big idea into an actual product. Once we figured out what the product would be, we tried to figure out what it looked like, how it would work, etc.\nBy this point, we were long-since out of cash. I’d taken on another daytime job to pay the bills. All-in-all, we burned a lot of time and a lot of cash just trying to figure out what the heck we were going to do. All along the way, we’d been trying to get VC funding so that we could feed our families and hire some people to help us make progress in narrowing our focus so that we could build something.\nUnfortunately, none of the VCs had ever heard of us before, and we didn’t have a product to show them yet. Finally, in May 2009 we restarted development in earnest. Over the next 10 months until I left to join Amazon Web Services, we were able to accomplish a lot considering how abysmally resource-constrained we were. The next time around, I plan to do a few things very differently.\n  I won’t quit my daytime job until I believe that the idea is going to go somewhere.\n  Focus on building the minimum viable product. In our case, we had to significantly narrow our scope so that we could figure out what to build first. We were all so excited about the future that we couldn’t figure out where to start.\n  Your customers are not venture capitalists, so don’t make the mistake of trying to build something that you think VCs will fund. Instead, build something that users will love. VC money will follow the users. In our case, we didn’t have the resources to build something awesome for users, so we tried to build for VCs to get the money to build for our users. This strategy never worked for us, not even once, and in retrospect it was one of the worst ideas we ever had.\n  Demo, don’t pitch. Again, VCs don’t care about pitches. If you’ve never done a successful startup before, then they’re not going to fund you anyway. If you don’t have something working that you can show them, don’t even bother setting up the meeting. Realistically, you need a working demo to pitch to angel investors. You need a live product with real users to pitch to VCs. If all that you show up with is a tie and a piece of paper talking about what your business plan is, you’ve just wasted the time of everybody in the room — including your own.\n  Perseverance is paramount. Once you go all-in on your startup, you need to be truly all-in. If you want to succeed, you need to treat this project like a life-or-death situation. You need to believe that you will live or die by the success of what you’re working on. If you hedge your bet and leave yourself an out, you won’t make it. Paul Graham, a VC from YCombinator, once said:\n When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they’ve become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that’s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can’t pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server. Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!\n This is the one piece of advice that got me through so many of those dark, demoralizing days. Just keep typing.\nConclusion. While my own experience as a startup founder has thus far led to a business that hasn’t yet succeeded, it doesn’t mean that yours will end up the same way. Whether you’re trying to do an Internet startup like me, or simply trying to start a consulting business out of your home, all of the aforementioned points apply.\n  Your business plan doesn’t matter. Doing something is what matters.\n  Choose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\n  If you’re looking for funding, only the check matters.\n  Focus on what you can do here and now — not at some arbitrary point in the future.\n  It can take a toll on your family.

This strategy never worked for us, not even once, and in retrospect it was one of the **worst** ideas we ever had.\n\n4. Demo, don’t pitch. Again, VCs don’t care about pitches. If you’ve never done a successful startup before, then they’re not going to fund you anyway. If you don’t have something working that you can show them, don’t even bother setting up the meeting. Realistically, you need a working demo to pitch to angel investors. You need a live product with real users to pitch to VCs. If all that you show up with is a tie and a piece of paper talking about what your business plan is, you’ve just wasted the time of everybody in the room — including your own.\n\n## Perseverance is paramount.\n\nOnce you go all-in on your startup, you need to be truly all-in. If you want to succeed, you need to treat this project like a life-or-death situation. You need to believe that you will live or die by the success of what you’re working on. If you hedge your bet and leave yourself an out, you won’t make it. Paul Graham, a VC from YCombinator, [once said]({{% wayback \"http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html\" %}}):\n\n\u003e When startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they’ve become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that’s working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can’t pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server. Startups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!\n\nThis is the one piece of advice that got me through so many of those dark, demoralizing days. Just keep typing.\n\n## Conclusion.\n\nWhile my own experience as a startup founder has thus far led to a business that hasn’t yet succeeded, it doesn’t mean that yours will end up the same way. Whether you’re trying to do an Internet startup like me, or simply trying to start a consulting business out of your home, all of the aforementioned points apply.\n\n1. Your business plan doesn’t matter. Doing something is what matters.\n\n2. Choose your business partners like you would choose your spouse.\n\n3. If you’re looking for funding, only the check matters.\n\n4. Focus on what you can do here and now — not at some arbitrary point in the future.\n\n5. It can take a toll on your family. Families can’t go on autopilot. Take time away from work to spend with the people you love.\n\n6. If you don’t ship, you have nothing. Or (if you’re providing a service instead of a product) if you’re not currently providing the service, you have nothing.\n\n7. The only person who can make this thing go is you. It will be hard. It will be frustrating. Make it go anyway.\n\nFinally, while this is by no means an exhaustive list, I would recommend spending some quality time digesting the writing from the following authors:\n\n* [Paul Graham]({{% wayback \"http://paulgraham.com/articles.html\" %}})\n* [Michael Lopp (aka “Rands”)]({{% wayback \"http://randsinrepose.com\" %}})\n* [Seth Godin]({{% wayback \"http://sethgodin.typepad.com\" %}})\n* [John Maeda]({{% wayback \"http://lawsofsimplicity.com\" %}})\n\n"},

        "plain":"Although the AWS SDK for PHP is growing as fast as Amazon’s breadth of web services, it should still be easy to find the information that you need in order to develop. This is a goal that I take very seriously.\nBack in 2005, I took a job with Stryker Endoscopy as a member of their Internal User Experience team, where our focus was on Usability and User-Centered Design (UCD). (I take no responsibility for how bad their public website is!) I gained some invaluable insight into the usability process and the principles behind UCD that I’ve carried with me over the years as I’ve migrated from UX and Front-End Development toward building Software Development Kits (SDKs) for infrastructure services. The most valuable of these is this:\n You can have all of the greatest functionality in the world. But if nobody can use it, what’s the point?\n I’m tempted to launch into a tirade against the stunning ignorance of software engineers who think we UX people “make it look pretty.” A Photoshop mockup does not a user experience make. Those same woefully uneducated people don’t understand how much science is involved in producing high-quality user interfaces — nor do they understand that if a person can’t figure out how to use the software, it’s not a problem with the person… it’s a problem with the software. As I’ve shifted toward producing developer-facing software, I’ve always maintained the notion that “developers are people too.” The administration and developer tools of some web applications are a crime against humanity. Of course, that’s what happens when you make the mistake of thinking that corporate stakeholders are your customers instead of Real Human Beings™. [I’m starting to rant. Let me switch gears.]\nI ♥ Quality I believe that documentation is equally — if not more — important as the code itself. It’s a critical part of the user (i.e., developer) experience right up there with API design and SDK design. When I was building CloudFusion (the pre-cursor to the AWS SDK for PHP), I spent quite a bit of time trying to find a high-quality documentation tool that delivered what I believed my users deserved. After searching for a good tool over the course of 2–3 years, I finally broke down and wrote my own tool that produced the kind of high-quality documentation that my users deserve. (That project is called “Vanity”, and is currently incubating).\nMaking It Better With the release of the AWS SDK for PHP 1.2.4, we really tried to raise the bar for our documentation. Here are some of the features that we now provide:\n  Rewrote the in-file documentation blocks to use the more common and better supported PHPDoc format instead of the NaturalDocs format we used previously.\n  Complete API reference documentation for all methods and classes.\n  One or more usage examples for nearly every single method.\n  Usage examples are generated from real PHPT tests, ensuring that the sample code actually works.\n  A breakdown of all complex parameters so that you can see what all of the possible options are.\n  The API reference documentation is available in HTML, raw XML, raw JSON and Serialized PHP formats.\n  Offline documentation can be downloaded as .zip, .gz and .bz2 archives.\n  Intelligent search along with a class browser.\n  View the source code of any method in the SDK.\n  The file that a given method is defined in.\n  Links out to the GitHub repository.\n  Complete inheritance chains and interface conformity.\n  Methods that are related to the one you’re looking at.\n  Links out to PHP.net, where appropriate.\n  Instant feedback, as in the ability to point out an error or some other issue directly on a page itself, instead of needing to hunt for a feedback link somewhere else in the site.\n  The ability to link directly to a search query.\n  It’s this last feature that I’ve come to talk about today — the ability to easily search the docs from tools you already use.\nSearching the AWS SDK for PHP documentation from Google Chrome For this, we need to tell Chrome to use the following pattern when searching the API reference.\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/?q=%s   Open the Google Chrome preferences panel.\n    In the Search section, click Manage Search Engines…. This will show the Search Engines panel.\n    In the Other search engines section, fill out the fields as shown below. The URL in the last field is the one I posted above.\n    Open a new tab. Typing \u0026ldquo;aws[space]\u0026rdquo; will trigger the AWS SDK for PHP search. Search for whichever keywords you’d like. At the time of this writing, classes, methods, properties and constants are supported.\n    This will open the SDK API reference documentation. Your search terms will be pre-filled in the search field on the left. You can navigate through the documentation from there!\n    Searching the AWS SDK for PHP documentation from Mozilla Firefox This process is very similar to Google Chrome.

        "source":"\nAlthough the AWS SDK for PHP is growing as fast as Amazon’s breadth of web services, it should still be easy to find the information that you need in order to develop. This is a goal that I take very seriously.\n\nBack in 2005, I took a job with [Stryker Endoscopy]({{% wayback \"http://stryker.com/endoscopy/\" %}}) as a member of their Internal User Experience team, where our focus was on Usability and User-Centered Design (UCD). (I take no responsibility for how bad their public website is!) I gained some invaluable insight into the usability process and the principles behind UCD that I’ve carried with me over the years as I’ve migrated from UX and Front-End Development toward building Software Development Kits (SDKs) for infrastructure services. The most valuable of these is this:\n\n\u003e You can have all of the greatest functionality in the world. But if nobody can use it, what’s the point?\n\nI’m tempted to launch into a tirade against the stunning ignorance of software engineers who think we UX people “make it look pretty.” *A Photoshop mockup does not a user experience make.* Those same *woefully* uneducated people don’t understand how much science is involved in producing high-quality user interfaces — nor do they understand that if a person can’t figure out how to use the software, it’s not a problem with the person… it’s a problem with the software. As I’ve shifted toward producing developer-facing software, I’ve always maintained the notion that “developers are people too.” The administration and developer tools of [some web applications]({{% wayback \"http://reardencommerce.com\" %}}) are a *crime against humanity*. Of course, that’s what happens when you make the mistake of thinking that corporate stakeholders are your customers instead of *Real Human Beings™*. \\[I’m starting to rant. Let me switch gears.\\]\n\n## I ♥ Quality\n\nI believe that documentation is equally — if not more — important as the code itself. It’s a critical part of the user (i.e., developer) experience right up there with API design and SDK design. When I was building *CloudFusion* (the pre-cursor to the AWS SDK for PHP), I spent quite a bit of time trying to find a high-quality documentation tool that delivered what I believed my users deserved. After searching for a good tool over the course of 2–3 years, I finally broke down and wrote my own tool that produced the kind of high-quality documentation that my users deserve. (That project is called “Vanity”, and is currently incubating).\n\n## Making It Better\n\nWith the release of the [AWS SDK for PHP 1.2.4]({{% wayback \"https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/release-aws-sdk-for-php-1-2-4/\" %}}), we really tried to raise the bar for our documentation. Here are some of the features that we now provide:\n\n* Rewrote the in-file documentation blocks to use the more common and better supported [PHPDoc]({{% wayback \"http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.quickstart.pkg.html#coding.phpcomments\" %}}) format instead of the [NaturalDocs]({{% wayback \"http://naturaldocs.org/documenting.html\" %}}) format we used previously.\n\n* Complete API reference documentation for all methods and classes.\n\n* One or more usage examples for nearly every single method.\n\n* Usage examples are generated from real [PHPT]({{% wayback \"http://qa.php.net/write-test.php\" %}}) tests, ensuring that the sample code actually works.\n\n* A breakdown of all complex parameters so that you can see what all of the possible options are.\n\n* The API reference documentation is available in HTML, raw XML, raw JSON and Serialized PHP formats.\n\n* Offline documentation can be downloaded as `.zip`, `.gz` and `.bz2` archives.\n\n* Intelligent search along with a class browser.\n\n* View the source code of any method in the SDK.\n\n* The file that a given method is defined in.\n\n* Links out to the [GitHub repository]({{% wayback \"https://github.com/amazonwebservices/aws-sdk-for-php\" %}}).\n\n* Complete inheritance chains and interface conformity.\n\n* Methods that are related to the one you’re looking at.\n\n* Links out to [PHP.net]({{% wayback \"http://php.net\" %}}), where appropriate.\n\n* Instant feedback, as in the ability to point out an error or some other issue directly on a page itself, instead of needing to hunt for a feedback link somewhere else in the site.\n\n* The ability to link directly to a search query.\n\nIt’s this last feature that I’ve come to talk about today — the ability to easily search the docs from tools you already use.\n\n## Searching the AWS SDK for PHP documentation from Google Chrome\n\nFor this, we need to tell Chrome to use the following pattern when searching the API reference.\n\n```plain\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/?q=%s\n```\n\n1. Open the Google Chrome preferences panel.\n\n    {{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chrome1.png\"\u003e}}\n\n2. In the *Search* section, click *Manage Search Engines…*. This will show the *Search Engines* panel.\n\n    {{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chrome2.png\"\u003e}}\n\n3. In the *Other search engines* section, fill out the fields as shown below. The URL in the last field is the one I posted above.\n\n    {{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chrome3.png\"\u003e}}\n\n4. Open a new tab. Typing \"*aws\\[space\\]*\" will trigger the AWS SDK for PHP search. Search for whichever keywords you’d like. At the time of this writing, classes, methods, properties and constants are supported.\n\n    {{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/chrome4.png\"\u003e}}\n\n5.

For this, we need to tell Firefox to use the following pattern when searching the API reference.\n\n```plain\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/?q=%s\n```\n\n1.

For this, we need to tell Alfred to use the following pattern when searching the API reference.\n\n```plain\nhttp://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/?q={query}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [following URL](alfredapp://customsearch/AWS%20SDK%20for%20PHP/sdk/utf8/url=http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/?q={query}) to accomplish what we’re going to do here:\n\n```plain\nalfredapp://customsearch/AWS%20SDK%20for%20PHP/aws/utf8/url=http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSDKforPHP/latest/?q={query}\n```\n\n1. Open the Alfred preferences, and choose *Custom Searches* from the sidebar. Once there, click the plus symbol at the bottom to add a new custom search.\n\n    {{\u003cfullimage src=\"https://cdn.ryanparman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/alfred1.png\"\u003e}}\n\n2. Fill out the fields as shown below. The URL in the *Search URL* field is the one I posted above.

However, after learning about Delicious’ sunsetting, I’ve decided to join the ranks of the Great Delicious Exodus and sign up for an account with Pinboard.\nOne tool that has been an important part of my workflow is a tool called delimport, which automatically indexes my Delicious bookmarks and makes them available via Spotlight and Spotlight-powered tools (e.g., Alfred on Mac OS X).\nWhile delimport hasn’t been updated since 2007, it has continued to work remarkably well. The upside is that the project has an open-source repository available, but I still ran into a few issues. Here’s how I added Pinboard support to delimport.\nGetting Started The first thing to note is that I’m running Mac OS X 10.6.5 and Xcode 3.2.5.
