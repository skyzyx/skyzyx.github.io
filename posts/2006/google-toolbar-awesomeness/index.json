Never ever EVER give out your pin # to ANYONE!!! Banks will never ask for this information (Other than asking you to enter you own pin # into a machine). Bank employees don’t even have access to your pin #. Your bank would never send you an email asking you to verify your personal information — the bank already has it if they need it. I recently received an email (I think that it was a bank from Tenessee); When I clicked on the link, it took me to a sign on page. It was really quite clever, you could enter any user ID, and any password. Then, they asked you to verify your bank information. (Including your pin) The other type of phishing email that I have been receiving a lot lately, has been on behalf of phony people from other countries. These people will ask you to reply to their email with your contact info. Then, they will try to get you to cash a fake cashier’s check from them of some ridiculously large amount. They will tell you that your cut is 30% or 40% in some cases. Don’t be fooled by these either. If you receive an email asking you for any sort of financial information/help know that it is probably a scam, you should delete it at once, or you can forward it to the Federal Trade Commission at \u003ca href=\"mailto:spam@uce.gov\"\u003espam@uce.gov\u003c/a\u003e, or contact them at \u003ca href=\"http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft\"\u003ewww.consumer.gov/idtheft\u003c/a\u003e or 877.IDTHEFT (877.438.4338).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n",
