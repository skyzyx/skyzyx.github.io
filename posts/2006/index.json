These people will ask you to reply to their email with your contact info. Then, they will try to get you to cash a fake cashier’s check from them of some ridiculously large amount. They will tell you that your cut is 30% or 40% in some cases. Don’t be fooled by these either.

I’ve read suggestions about using utf–16/ucs–2 values, but how do you find them and how do you convert them? This led me on a journey to figure out how to handle this. I ended up digging through some [TinyMCE]({{% wayback \"http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/\" %}}) source code, and found a gem of a function that I then added a ‘stupefy’ mode to. Here’s the code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction entity(str, mode) {\n    var str = (str) ? str : '';\n    var mode = (mode) ? mode : 'string';\n\n    var e = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    e.innerHTML = str;\n\n    if (mode === 'numeric') {\n        return '\u0026#' + e.innerHTML.charCodeAt(0) + ';';\n    } else if (mode === 'utf16') {\n        var un = e.innerHTML.charCodeAt(0).toString(16);\n\n        while (un.length \u003c 4) {\n            un = \"0\" + un;\n        }\n\n        return \"\\\\u\" + un;\n    }\n\n    return e.innerHTML;\n}\n```\n\n`entity()` has two parameters:\n\n1. **entity:** is a string which can be either a named entity (\u0026raquo;) or a numeric entity (\u0026\\#187;)\n2. **mode:** is an optional value that accepts ‘numeric’, ‘utf16’, or ‘string’. Defaults to ‘string’.\n\nYou’d use it like this:\n\n```javascript\n// Normal mode\nvar div = document.createElement('div');\nvar text = document.createTextNode('Parent ' + entity('»') + ' Child');\ndiv.appendChild(text);\n\n// Stupefy mode\nvar num = \"The numeric entity for » is \" + entity('»', 'numeric');\nvar utf = \"The UTF-16 entity for » is \" + entity('»', 'utf16');\n```\n\nI hope this can help other people out there who’ve run into the same problem as many times as I have!\n"},

In my source code, I’ll have an empty `\u003cul\u003e` tag with an ID, then I use that ID when I go and add `\u003cli\u003e`’s to it. No big deal, right? If you use the standard view-source contextual menu item, it will show you the source code that you coded in: the empty `\u003cul\u003e` tag. BUT, if after you’ve added your `\u003cli\u003e` nodes dynamically, you click-and-drag to select the rendered area, and choose “View Selection Source”, Firefox will show you the fully-rendered HTML for that area.\n\nAs in, it will show you the `\u003cul\u003e` tag with all of your `\u003cli\u003e` tags inside of it… just as though you’d coded it like that in the first place. How awesome is that? So if you need to see what HTML your JavaScript is generating, simply select the area, and choose “View Selection Source”.\n"},
